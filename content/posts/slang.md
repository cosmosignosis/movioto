Possibly the most popular scientific word of current times Robot was introduced for the first time in the play Rossum's Universal Robots written by Karel Capek way back in 1920. However, the way the word Robot is defined in the play is much different from the common knowledge of Robots. Capek defines Robots as artificial biological organisms and not as mere automated machines. The word Robot itself is derived from the Czech root word "robota" which means forced labour.

Arthur C. Clarke coined the term Zero-g in his 1952 novel Islands in the sky. Whehter its the internet, email or space travel to some extent Clarke may get the credit for predicting all of these and many more things. In his first novel prelude to space which was published in 1947, Clarke rightly predicted that the first moon rocket would be launched in 1959. These were the Luna1, Luna2 and Luna3 spacecrafts - all of which where launched in the same year and played varying degree of roles in the mission to moon. Beyond these Clarke can also be given credit for the coinage of numerous other terms like automatic control cars and zero-g even though only as a term and not as a concept.

H.G Wells coined the word atom bomb in his novel world set free in 1914. Althouugh the word seems self explanatory not deserving of original coinage of the term but at the time it culd have had any name from fission bomb, radiation bomb or nuclear bomb. Hence as self explanatory as it may seem Wells still gets the credit.
