## 1. Robot 

![Robotic](/img/05/RUR.png "Robots")  

The word Robot is just as iconic as the idea behind it. Google describes the word Robot as a "machine resembling a human being" - now we have seen crazy stuff in the world of science fiction but this is truly the pinnacle imitation of god'sown creation. Robot was introduced for the first time in the Karel Capek's 1920 science fiction play R.U.R (Rossum's Universal Robots). The word Robot itself is derived from the Czech root word "robota" which means forced labour or servitude. The play is set in a dystopian world where the robots are rapidly replacing humans in every aspect of the life. It's been more than a century since the premiere of the play and even now the the premise of the play is just as relevant as the word Robot. However, the meaning of the word Robot has evolved from what Karel intended it to be. In the play Robot refers to artifical biological organism and not automated machines.

truly it doesn't get any crazier thaAn Possibly the most popular scientific word of current times Robot was introduced for the first time in the play Rossum's Universal Robots written by Karel Capek way back in 1920. However, the way the word Robot is defined in the play is much different from the common knowledge of Robots. Capek defines Robots as artificial biological organisms and not as mere automated machines. The word Robot itself is derived from the Czech root word "robota" which means forced labour. -->

## 2. Mission to moon

![moon](/img/05/space.png "Travel")  

If ever there was a science fiction hall of fame Arthur C. Clarke deserves to be in it. From coining the term Zero-g in his 1952 novel Islands in the Sky to predicting internet and emails, his impact is undeniable. However, his most iconic prediction remains moon rocket launch. He wrote about it it in his first novel Prelude to Space in the year 1947, and sure enough just 12 years ater he wrote about it,  the first mission to moon began with Luna1, Luna2 and Luna3 spacecrafts. 

Even though for a lot of the terms he coined like automatic control cars or zero-g the concept behind the terms is not the same as what he wrote about, hss

Arthur C. Clarke coined the term Zero-g in his 1952 novel Islands in the sky. Whehter its the internet, email or space travel to some extent Clarke may get the credit for predicting all of these and many more things. In his first novel prelude to space which was published in 1947, Clarke rightly predicted that the first moon rocket would be launched in 1959. These were the Luna1, Luna2 and Luna3 spacecrafts - all of which where launched in the same year and played varying degree of roles in the mission to moon. Beyond these Clarke can also be given credit for the coinage of numerous other terms like automatic control cars and zero-g even though only as a term and not as a concept. -->

Neuromancer is one of the most famous sci-fi novels for various reasons however did you know that this masterpiece by Stephen Gibson gave the word cyberspace its first breakthrough. In the novel cyberspace essentially refers to virtual reality where peoople can access and manipulate data. THe meaning of the word in the novel is not too far removed from what we use cyberspace to refer to in the actual world.

![moon](/img/05/selfreplicatingprogram.png "Travel")

Another similar idea Virus was used by David Gerrold for then first time with respect to computers in 1972 story When Harlie was One.

## 5. Avatar 

![select](/img/05/avatar.png "Avatar") 

The word Avatar has its roots in Hinduism and means descent. However the game designer Rirchard Garriott is behind the meaning of the word avatar as we know and use it nowdays.  Garriott started using the word Avatar in the current computer related meaning in the fourth chapter of his roleplay game series Ultima - Ultima IV: Quest of the Avatar. In this chapter players could create and control an avatar by choosing its name, race, gender and other appearance related details. 

## 6. Atom Bomb

![wells](/img/05/wells.png "atom") 

H.G Wells coined the word atom bomb in his novel world set free in 1914. Althouugh the word seems self explanatory and way too intuitive to give someone the credit for coming up with it but that's retrospective thinking. At the time it could have had any of the countless possible names like fission bomb, radiation bomb, or even nuclear bomb which perhaps would be more intuitive. Hence as self explanatory as it may seem Wells sure should get the credit for it.
