Science fiction is a genre that works extremely well as a cinema. With so many good graphic novels in the genre, it's safe to say there are dozens of science fiction graphic novels deserving of a movie adaptation. Moreover, the success of such hits as V for Vendetta and Watchmen, has proved that sci-fi fans love a transition from paper to the big screen if the adaptation does justice to the material.

Though reading, as good of a habit as it is, is not the most accessible of mediums since for the vast majority of people its easier to watch a movie than read a book. As a result numerous fantastic stories and characters are trapped and hidden awayy from general audiences and are yet to be adapted. Here is my pick of top 10 that deserve it the most:

<!-- Though reading, as popular of a hobby as it is, can sometimes be a medium where fantastic stories are trapped and hidden away from general audiences.As such there are plenty more sci-fi graphic novels that need to make a step into movies.

<!-- Science Fiction projects require imagination and creativity. Graphic novels are the one place where the artists and writers fleeing from censor let their imagination unfold.

 <!-- has proved that fans appreciate a well done transition of characters and stories from paper to screen. -->

<!-- there's no question the fans want their favorite characters and stories to transition from the world of ink and paper to the big screens. -->

<!-- it's easy to understand why the world of ink and paper can have such an astounding and dedicated fanbase to want them on big screen -->



<!-- Reading, as popular of a hobby as it is, can sometimes be limiting medium especially for a genre like sci-fi where the use of effects and high value production can really improve the experience the story has to offer. Additionally not many people read a lot of graphic novels which is why fantastic stories are trapped and hidden away from the general audiences. 

As such there are plenty more sci-fi graphic novels that need to make a step into movies. Here is my pick of top 10 that deserve it the most: -->


<!-- Though despite the popularity of characters like Batman and the avengers, there are still legions of untapped potential. There are loads of graphic novels in the sci-fi genre that have yet to be adapted. What better time than age where the medium is a wellspring of adaptations? 

## 1. Tokyo Ghost By Rick Remender

## 1. The Manhattan Projects by Jonathan Hickman 

This comic, which combines historical settings and events with fictionalized characters with a heavy dose of science fiction and a bit of horror, holds a rather unique selling point. THe Manhattan Projects follows the events around the Manhattan Project from world war two but its an alternate reality where the creation of atom bomb is shown as just a front for other unusual projects. In this novel's alternative american reality Robert Oppenheimer suffers from multiple personalities. The plot deals with everything from nuclear bombs to the Holocaust to artificial intelligence. It is a fantastic blend of historical truth and insane fiction

<!-- dark bitter humor in a morally starved world of the book; gross ross, repulsive, appalling look at science and government without conscience (or with a desecrated version of conscience.) At the same time, it’s not an overly serious book -->

Hickman's novel is a retelling of an important part of american history. On the big screen would be a dark bitter humorous movie that shows a morally starved world and throws and appalling light on science and government without conscience (or with a desecrated version of conscience) but at the same time withyout being too serious - maybe it's the perfect sci-fi project for Quentin Tarantino

<!-- Cleeton's novel is an intimate retelling of Cuban history — the big screen could do with more diverse stories. -->


## 2. On a Sunbeam (Tillie Walden)

Putting dark history aside for a moment, take a look at a strange tale that is On a sunbeam. On a sunbeam can't truly be put into any one genre. It has elements of both science fiction and romance. The story follows Mia who works in a maintenance spaceship that rebuilds broken structures. Howver her sole purpose for joining the ship is not to rebuild structures but rebuild an old relationship by reconnecting with her lost love. The story takes you on an emotional rollercosaster that will make you laugh and cry sometimes both at the same time. The second half of the novel however is more action loaded and less emotionally charged.

The writer's imaginative storytelling combined with the desperation and hope that accompany the characters make On a Sunbeam a worthy candidate for a memorable romantic sci-fi film with some good action sequences as well - this could end up being the movie that has everything!

Its been sometime s


Walden's webcomic with its explosive ending is long overdue for a staggering thriller of a  movie

## 3. Sentient (Jeff Lemire)

Imagine a group of children stuck in a colony ship in deep space forced to survive on their own after all the adults on the ship get murdered. THe only help they have is the guidance of the onboard AI VALARIE. While survival is the strongest instinct in humans distrust towards AI is the most common sentiment. So the idea that these children now have no other option but to trust AI for survival is an extremely interesting premise.

That's roughly the setup of Sentient by Jeff Lemire. It features plenty of science fiction tropes such as an space pirate invasion, kids in space, AI learning to be a human and a colony ship. A young adult science fiction like Sentient which is a bit soft on science but deals with dystopia, identity and spaceship drama is rare these days so this is definitely a unique novel. Lemire's novel would be absolutely perfect for horror space opera movie or even a miniseries, and someone needs to tip off the studio executives.

<!-- layer of mystery that unfolds into something much more important and impactful than any of the characters involved anticipated.  -->



## 4. (Worlds of) Aldebaran  by Luiz Eduardo de Oliveira


Luiz Eduardo de Oliveira's Worlds of Aldebaran may sound like science-fiction roleplaying game, but its actually the name of his book that was first released in 1994. The simple but potent idea of humans trying to capture distant planet when Earth becomes inhabitable due to global warming and religious wars would capture the imagination of any sci-fi fan. Even though the plot sounds like something Elon Musk would talk about it is definitely a great place to start a science fiction story.

Though it shares some similarities to the beloved space adventure star trek, it also leans into many of the less popular sci-fi mainstays like corrupt church, body horror and suicide. The novels main focus is colonists dealing with planet level issues that arise due to human error, however the novel does have a tragic tone when it deals with personal problems. Oliveira's book with it space western feel is long overdue for staggering series.

## 5. The Incal By Alejandro Jodorowsky
In 1980 Alejando Jordowsky creating a fascinating science fiction tale called the Incal which would later be seen as one of the most legendary French-Belgian Comic.
If you have seen the documentary Jodorowsky's Dune(2013) then you have probably heard about it. Jordowsky's motivation behind this comic is just as notoriously famous as the comic itself.  He wanted to adapt Dune for the big screen but he ended up changing the story too much and the screenplay ended up being 14 hour long. So naturally he couldn't get the budget for it but he did convert it into a graphic novel of its own with the help of French artist Jean Giraud or Mœbius.

This beautiful piece of graphic literature revolves around John Difool, a low class detective in a degenerate dystopian world, who finds his life turned upside down when he discovers an ancient, mystical artifact called "The Incal". THe character and the main story line is definitely something that would attract even the sci-fi fans who aren't aware of the novel itself. Moreover, tHe artwork itself, if translated properly, could lead to visually stunning movie or a series.



## 6. Joe Haldeman's The Forever War

The premise alone of this series should warrant an adaptation, although it's definitely not for the faint of heart at all because to some extent it shows the reality of war. Haldmen tells the story about human soldiers fighting in a interstellar war with a hostlie alien enemy civilization the Taurans. In many ways the Forever war is the pioneer of the sci-fi military genre along with Heinlein’s Starship Troopers.’ However once you read it you will have an entirely different experience than Startship troopers or even Man's war by Scalzi. You follow the story through the eyes of the main protagonist William Mandela who is just an ordinary person studying physics at a university but is pulled into the war to contribute. Even though you may find several plot points to be a bit unnerving like the views on homosexuality the novel is definitely a masterpiece and worth a read.

THe rigsht to adapt The Forever War has moved through various hands in hollywood since 1988 with Ridley Scott being the one to hold the right at one point. In 2015 Warner Bros acqiored the right to adapt the film and have started the development of the script however so far nothing has come to fruitiion. It's not surprising why so many big names want to adapt this film because if done right it surely has the potential to be a genre defining project.


## 7. Global Frequency  Warren Ellis

The Sci-fi epic Global Frequency has everything: emotionally charging drama, incredible action, mystery, engaging character development  and a bone chilling plotline. The series is just as great as Planetary - another creation of Ellis. The novel already has an army of fans behind it, and for good reason. Global Frequency, despite its popularity is one of the most underrated comic works of the 21st century. THe novel follows the operations of an intelligence agency that counters that governements and protects the people its secret projects. 

So far there have been two attempts at adapting the novel into a tv series once by Warner Bros and the second time by Fox. However, both times the project was dropped due to problems with the script. The sci-fi series of 12 issues has a near perfect plot with tons of interesting subplots involving fights with alien and governments and the use of futuristic technology making it an ideal contender for the development of a netflix show. 


## 8. Not All Robots - Mark Russell

In 2021 Mark Russell delivered a fascinating science fiction satirical/social commentary in the form of the novel Not All Robots. 
 The central premise of Not All Robots is that every human family is completely reliant on a robot assigned to them. The novel follows Walters family whose Robot ominously spends his free time in the garage working on machines which they are sure is designed to kill them in.

 THough it shares some similarities to chatoic futiristic series like Love death and robots it deals with the idea of mulutula exisiteneco f machines ad himans in a much more funnier way. An animated series or a movie where sociological impact of AI is explored sounds like a project that the fans will definitely love.
## extremely relevant to current times A movie version of Noli Me Tangere would resonate strongly in today's world, where movements for social justice and decolonization continue to gain momentum.

<!-- This novel, which is a satirical commentary on a dystopian society, has an extremely attractive story wherein the humans are co-existing with intelligent robots. -->


## 9. We3 by writer Grant Morrison

The name We3 might not sound all too familiar to general audiences, but the novel by Grant Morrison actually inspired several elements in the beloved Marvel film Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3. When looking at what makes a science fiction movie entertaining, three cybernetic animals who are created by the governmment and are trying to get home feels like a winning recipe. We3 also has the added inclusion of government conspiracy


We3 also has the added inclusion of aliens, pirates and futuristic tech all of which result in horrific scenarios where someone's life is almost always in danger. Even though the challenge of adapting this novel can be a bit daunting and challenging but it would be tremendous accomplisment if done properly

<!-- housue pets weaponized for lethal combat by the government - as they search for home and ward off the shadowy agency that created them feels like a winning recipe

## 10. The Coffin - Phil Hester

The combination of science fiction and superheros is bound to be a winning one in the world of movies. The Coffin follows Dr. Ashtar Ahmad who is pursuing the dream of immortality by building a suit the can store the soul even after the physical body dies and the person can live on forever. However his research comes to an abrupt halt when a tycoon kidnaps his daugther and asks for doctor's suit as ransom. It's twisted, it's firghtening, it's darkly funny, it's everything you would expect from such a premise.

On the one hand, thid could make for a gory flick. On the other hand it's definitely one of the most original approahces to superhero thriller story becaus even with a basic premise the execution is spectacular and will keep you on the edge of your seat. Wester's book may have been published in 2001, but there is still quite like it in the film industry 20 years later, and this has to be fixed.
