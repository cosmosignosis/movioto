SpaceX and Tesla founder tweeted in 2018 that the original star wars was his favourite film. The sci fi classic was later renamed to Star Wars: Episode IV – A New Hope because the prequel trilogy was set before it and also because Lucas thought this was the best movie and didn’t want to release the prequels first because in case they failed he wouldn’t have got the financing for the rest of the movies.
