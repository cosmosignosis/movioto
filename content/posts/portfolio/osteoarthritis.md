## What is osteoarthritis?
Osteoarthritis is a form of arthritis that causes loss of function in the joints of the body. It is a degenerative joint disease wherein the cartilage between the bones of a joint breaks down. You may also know it as wear and tear arthritis. In this disease, due to the deterioration of tendons and ligaments and damage to the cartilage, you may experience pain, swelling, immobility, and deformity of the joints. Generally, osteoarthritis (OA) can affect any joint, but more commonly, it affects the joints in:
- Hands
- Knees
- Hips
- Lower back
- Neck

Osteoarthritis is the most prevalent of all joint diseases that are age-related. On average, more than 80% of people over the age of 55 are at risk of developing osteoarthritis.

### Types of Osteoarthritis:
- **Primary**: Caused due to gradual wear and tear of the cartilage and the joints.
- **Secondary**: Caused as a consequence of other diseases or a pre-existing condition.

> **Note**: A cartilage is a firm, slippery, and flexible tissue that covers and connects the ends of the bones that form a joint.

## What are the symptoms of Osteoarthritis?
The symptoms of osteoarthritis gradually build up over time. Some common symptoms include:
- Clicking and popping sounds in the joint
- Stiffness in the joints – usually happens in the morning when you wake up
- Instability and weakness in the knee
- Imbalance
- Swelling around the joint
- Pain when you use the joints. Pain increases after a long day of physical activity
- Loss of range of motion and functionality

### Effect of Osteoarthritis on Different Joints
| **Joint** | **Differential Effect** |
|-----------|--------------------------|
| Fingers   | Bony projections in finger joints causing swelling, tenderness, and redness. Pain at the base of the thumb |
| Hips      | Pain in the groin, inside the knee, or thigh |
| Knees     | Discomfort while moving the knee |
| Feet      | Pain, tenderness, and swelling in the toe and ankles |

## What is the main cause of Osteoarthritis?
Osteoarthritis is a degenerative disease that affects the joints, and its prime cause is the gradual deterioration of the cartilage between the bones of a joint. This tissue acts as a cushion between the bones and could get damaged due to several reasons, including:
- Aging
- Injury
- Overuse
- Bad posture
- Occupation (sitting or kneeling for prolonged hours)
- Obesity
- Genetics
- Gender (women are at a higher risk)

> **Note**: Even though osteoarthritis is a disease of the joints, it affects the whole bone and the associated functionality.

## What is the best doctor to see for osteoarthritis?
If you notice the symptoms of osteoarthritis, consult one of the following specialists:
- Rheumatologists
- Orthopedists
- Physical therapists
- Occupational therapists

---

## How do I know if I have osteoarthritis? (Diagnosis)
If you suspect osteoarthritis, consult your healthcare provider. Your doctor may recommend the following tests:
- **Joint Aspiration (Arthrocentesis)**: Extracts synovial fluid from the joint to check for urate crystals and rule out other causes.
- **X-ray**: Identifies damage in joints or altered alignment of bones.
- **Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)**: Provides a detailed view of cartilage and surrounding ligaments (recommended if severe damage is suspected).

## What is the best treatment for Osteoarthritis?
While there is no cure for osteoarthritis, treatments can help manage symptoms and improve quality of life. Treatment goals include:
1. Controlling pain.
2. Improving function and mobility.
3. Educating patients about the disease and pain management.
4. Preventing complications from overlooked causes.

### Severity-Based Treatment Options
| **Severity**            | **Treatment Option**                                                                                         |
|--------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Low                      | Non-pharmacological management (education, exercise, weight loss, proper footwear)                          |
| Mild                     | Non-pharmacological management + physiotherapy or braces                                                   |
| Mild to Moderate         | Non-pharmacological management + pharmacological management (e.g., analgesics, counterirritants)            |
| Moderate                 | Pharmacological management (e.g., NSAIDs, corticosteroids, intra-articular hyaluronan injections)           |
| High                     | Surgery (e.g., osteotomy, joint replacement)                                                               |

### Medications
1. **Analgesics**: Relieve pain.
2. **Nonsteroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs)**: Reduce inflammation and pain.
3. **Corticosteroid Injections**: Administered directly into the joint for short-term pain and inflammation relief.
4. **Hyaluronan Injections**: Provide lubrication by injecting hyaluronic acid into the joint.
5. **Counterirritants**: Over-the-counter medications for localized pain relief.

## Surgery
Surgery is considered a last resort for severe osteoarthritis. It may be recommended if:
- The pain is excruciating.
- The condition prevents walking or daily activities.
- The pain interferes with sleep.

### Types of Surgery
1. **Arthroscopic Debridement and Lavage**: Removal of loose materials blocking the joint.
2. **Osteotomy**: Realignment, shortening, or lengthening of bones to reduce pain.
3. **Joint Replacement**: Improves pain, range of motion, and joint functionality.

## Best Natural Treatments for Osteoarthritis – Home Remedies
1. **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can improve joint mobility and reduce stiffness.
   - **Resistance Exercises**: Chair stand, wall squats, knee extensions.
   - **Stretching Exercises**: Inner leg stretch, hip rotation.
   - **Balance Exercises**: Single-leg stand, chair stand.
   - **Yoga**: Mountain pose, bound angle pose, staff pose.
2. **Weight Loss**: Reduces pressure on joints and slows joint damage.
3. **Rest**: Manage mild to moderate pain with adequate rest.
4. **Cold and Heat Treatment**: Ice packs or warm baths can alleviate pain.
5. **Blood Sugar Control**: Prevents cartilage stiffening and reduces inflammation.

## Alternative Treatments
- **Physiotherapy**: Improves mobility and posture.
- **Occupational Therapy**: Corrects joint movements in daily activities.
- **Acupuncture**: Reduces pain and improves functionality.

---

## Who is More Prone to Osteoarthritis?
Answer "yes" to any of these questions? You may be at higher risk:

- Hypermobility?
- Weak muscles?
- Poor posture?
- History of torn meniscus or diabetes?

---

## Can Osteoarthritis Be Prevented?
While complete prevention is challenging, you can reduce the risk by:
- Maintaining a healthy weight.
- Taking care of joints with proper posture and avoiding injuries.

- Following a healthy diet.

### Key Takeaways:
- Avoid injuries.
- Include exercises like chair stand, wall squats, and knee extensions.

## Can Osteoarthritis Be Permanently Cured?
No, osteoarthritis cannot be cured. However, with proper understanding and management of symptoms, associated pain can be significantly reduced.
