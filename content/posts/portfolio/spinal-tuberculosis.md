## What is Spinal TB?
Spinal tuberculosis is a type of bone tuberculosis that affects the nerves and the nervous system. The bacteria *Mycobacterium* is the primary pathogen that causes this disease. The spine is the most common site of skeletal tuberculosis (disease involving the bones and the joints) – in about 1% of all tuberculosis cases, the spinal column is affected.

Also known as Pott's disease or Pott's spine, it is caused because of:
- Compression of neural structures
- Spinal deformity.

### Spinal TB can manifest itself in the following forms:
- Back pain
- Paraplegia – Paralysis of the lower half of the body
- Spinal tenderness
- Deformities in the spine

**Alert:** Tuberculosis of the spine is a severe disease and can cause serious functional impairment; therefore, early diagnosis and treatment of the disease are crucial to avoid severe lifelong complications.

While it can affect anybody, children and young adults are at a higher risk of developing spinal TB.

**Note:** Tuberculosis is an infectious disease caused by bacteria, and it usually affects the lungs; however, it can have an impact on other organs of the body as well.

**Trivia:** Pott's disease is one of the oldest disorders that has affected humans; however, it gets its name from Sir Percivall Pott, who first described spinal tuberculosis in 1779.

## How common is spinal TB?
Skeletal tuberculosis forms about 50% of all the cases of musculoskeletal tuberculosis – TB in bones and muscles.

---

## What are the symptoms of spinal TB?
There is a risk of the following changes in the body of a person suffering from spinal TB:
- Destruction of the space between the vertebrates
- Destruction of the front of the vertebra – called the centrum
- Damage in the spinal cord and the associated nerve roots, tendons, ligaments, and muscles
- Deformity in the bones of the backbone that are attached to the ribs – anterior wedging

### Symptoms:
- Back pain
- Local tenderness
- Stiffness
- Muscle spasms
- A cold abscess (pus build-up) – no pain or inflammation
- Gibbus – a back disorder in which there is a deformity in the upper back and middle back
- Prominent spinal deformity

The development of spinal TB is slow and gradual. Its symptoms may go unnoticed for several years since they take time to develop fully. The disease can last from a few months to several years. However, typically the average duration of the disease is 4 to 11 months.

The growth of spinal tuberculosis is so slow that patients generally notice something odd when there is:
- Severe pain
- Visible deformity
- Neurological symptoms

### Differential or distinguishing symptoms of spinal tuberculosis:
While the symptoms like muscle spasms and stiffness may be associated with other causes, the following three are the most common and characteristic symptoms of spinal TB, so ignoring them can be dangerous in the long run:

#### 1. Back Pain
Back pain is the most common and frequent symptom of spinal tuberculosis. The severity of the pain can vary between mild, dull aching to severe, causing immobility. The portion of the spine between the upper back and the abdomen (thoracic region) is the most susceptible to pain.

**Alert:** In 61% of the cases of spinal TB, chronic back pain was the only symptom; therefore, clearly, it must not be overlooked as it may gradually lead to irreversible damage.

If the back pain is a symptom of tuberculosis of the spine, you will notice a considerable increase in pain whenever you:
- Cough
- Carry a lot of weight
- Move along the spine

This happens because of:
- Advanced disc disruption
- Compression in the nerve root
- Spinal instability
- Pathological fracture – when the bone breaks because of a disease and not an injury

**Note:** Spinal motions include the following movements:
- Flexion – curling or bending
- Extensions – arching
- Rotation – turning
- Lateral glide – side-to-side motion
- Lateral flexion – side bends
- Circumduction – circular movement of the spine

#### 2. Neurological Symptoms
Whenever there is a problem associated with the back or neck, there is a high risk of neurological problems. There is a 23-76% chance that someone suffering from spinal TB will have neurological deficits.

**Alert:** If the neurological symptoms and deficits are ignored, it may lead to:
- **Paraplegia** – paralysis caused by damage in:
  - Upper back (thoracic region)
  - Lower back (lumbar region)
  - Area between the lower back and the tailbone (sacral region)
- **Tetraplegia** – paralysis caused by damage in the neck (cervical region)

**Note:** Paraplegia can occur at any time of the disease.

Depending on the section of the spinal cord affected by TB, the neurological symptoms and problems may vary:
1. **Cervical spinal tuberculosis:**
   - Cord or root compression symptoms
   - Early signs include:
     - Pain
     - Weakness
     - Numbness of upper and lower extremities
     - Hyperflexia – overactive reflexes
   - Eventually, numbness leads to tetraplegia.

   **Note:** The upper extremities include the arms, while the lower extremities include the legs.

2. **Thoracic or lumbar spine tuberculosis:**
   - No problems with upper extremity functions; symptoms of pain, weakness, and numbness in lower extremities. Progresses to paraplegia over time.

   **Note:** Reflexes differ in spinal TB and other conditions like cauda equina compression:
   - Cauda equina compression: Reflexes reduced
   - Spinal TB: Hyperflexia (overactive reflexes)

#### 3. Formation of Cold Abscess
A characteristic feature of spinal tuberculosis, cold abscesses form around the spinal lesion and grow large. The symptoms depend on the affected spine section:
- **Cervical region:** Retropharyngeal abscess causing:
  - Dysphagia – difficulty swallowing
  - Respiratory distress
  - Hoarseness of voice
  - Neck stiffness
- **Thoracic spine:** Tapered abscess causing posterior mediastinal lumps (back lumps)
- **Lumbar spine:** Swelling in the groin or thigh; pus travels through thigh and hip vessels and lodges behind hips.

#### 4. Spinal Deformity
The most distinguishing symptom of spinal TB. The type of deformity depends on the spine section affected.

**Kyphosis:** Excessive curvature of the spine (hunchback) caused by lesions in the thoracic region. Severity depends on the number of infected thoracic vertebrae. Deformity remains after treatment in about 20% of cases; severe kyphosis occurs in only 3%.

## What causes spinal TB?
The conditions making you susceptible to spinal TB are the same as tuberculosis:
- Poverty
- Overcrowding
- Malnutrition
- Alcoholism
- Drug abuse
- Diabetes
- HIV treatment
- Immunosuppressive treatment

Tuberculosis affects the spine when *Mycobacterium tuberculosis* spreads through the circulatory system, targeting the cancellous bone tissue in the vertebral body.

**Note:** 
- **In children:** Infection occurs in vascularized intervertebral discs.
- **In adults:** Infection spreads from vertebral body to paraspinal area.

Gradual bone destruction can lead to vertebral collapse or kyphosis. Spinal compression and neurological defects occur due to:
- Cold abscess
- Granulation tissue
- Direct dural invasion

## Diagnosis and Treatment
**Diagnosis Tests:**
- Tuberculin skin test
- ESR
- PCR and immunological tests
- Needle biopsy
- Radiography
- CT Scan and MRI (most definitive)

**Treatment Options:**
- **Medications:** Antituberculosis drugs
- **Spinal orthosis:** Braces for pain relief and deformity prevention
- **Surgery:** For neurological defects or severe deformities

**Note:** Early treatment is crucial to avoid complications.
