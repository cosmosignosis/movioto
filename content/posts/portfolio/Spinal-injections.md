## What are spinal injections?
Spinal injections are injections given in various parts of the spinal column. Typically, spinal injections are part of a treatment plan.

## Why are spinal injections given?
Spinal injections are given for two primary purposes:

- **Diagnosis**: In some cases, spinal injections are given to diagnose the source of pain in different parts of the body.
- **Medication**: Spinal injections are also given to administer medicines to reduce pain in different parts of the body.

## What are the different types of spinal injections?
The different types of spinal injections are:

- Epidural injections
- Injections given in the Facet joint
- Injections given in the Sacroiliac joint
- Provocative Discography

## Epidural Injections

### What are epidural injections?
Epidural injections are injections given for the treatment of pain and inflammation in the spine (back) or the arms and legs. The likely cause of pain in your arm/legs is an inflammation or compression in the nerves, also referred to as a pinched nerve or Radiculopathy.

**Note**: The epidural space is the area between the durameter (a membrane that protects the spinal cord) and the vertebral wall. The epidural space contains many blood vessels.

### What is an epidural injection used for?
Epidural injections are one of several treatment routes available for pain relief. Generally, they are part of a comprehensive treatment plan.

Your doctor may recommend an epidural injection if any of the following are diagnosed as the underlying cause of your pain:

- **Spinal Stenosis**: Abnormal narrowing of spaces within your spine, putting pressure on the nerves, affecting the lower back and neck.
- **Herniated disk**: Also known as a slipped or prolapsed disk, this condition occurs when a portion of the nucleus moves out of its rubbery encasing (annulus) due to injury.
- **Failed spinal surgery**: Post-operative symptoms like leg or arm pain may persist.
- **Spinal nerves and vertebrae injury**: Reduces inflammation and alleviates pain around the spinal nerves.
- **Bone spurs**: Bony outgrowths at the edges of bones forming a joint.

Epidural injections may also be used to diagnose the source of the pain.

### How do epidural injections work?

#### Therapeutic Use
Epidural injections are used to administer medications into the epidural space. Medications include:

- **Anesthesia**
- **Anti-inflammatory medication** like corticosteroids to reduce inflammation and provide pain relief.

#### Sites of Injection

| Point of Injection         | How the Medication Moves                        | Purpose                   |
|----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|---------------------------|
| Lower back – lumbar injection | Injected directly into the epidural space       | Alleviates lower back pain |
| Neck – cervical injection  | Injected into the cervical epidural space      | Alleviates neck pain      |

After the medications are administered, they cover distressed and inflamed nerve roots, providing pain relief. On average, the relief from epidural corticosteroid injections lasts for 3 months.

#### Diagnostic Use
Epidural injections can diagnose the source of the pain. The immediate response to the dose determines if the targeted nerve is causing the pain.

Possible outcomes:
- **Complete pain relief**: Confirms that the nerve was the source of pain.
- **Partial or minimal relief**: Indicates that the nerve is not the source.

## Facet Joint Block – Spinal Injections in the Facet Joint

### What are facet joint blocks?
A facet joint block is a surgical procedure involving an injection of medication into the facet joint to control pain or inflammation. The procedure is guided by fluoroscopy or CT scans.

### What is a facet joint?
Facet joints are small joints located between and behind each vertebra in the spine.

### Why is a facet joint injection given?
- To diagnose the cause of pain.
- To provide long-term pain relief.
- To reduce inflammation.
- For pain caused by arthritis or injury.

### How do facet joint injections work?

#### Treatment
The injections are placed into and around the joints, treating pain in:
- Neck
- Middle back
- Lower back

#### Diagnosis
Two approaches are used:
1. Anesthesia injected into the joint. If pain is reduced, a follow-up steroid injection is given.
2. Anesthesia injected into medial nerve branches. If pain is relieved, radiofrequency ablation (burning the nerve causing pain) is performed.

## Sacroiliac Joint Injections

### What are sacroiliac joint injections?
A sacroiliac joint injection administers anesthetic or steroid medication into the Sacroiliac joint for treating:
- Lower back pain
- Leg pain
- Pain in the buttocks

### What is a sacroiliac joint?
A sacroiliac joint links the pelvis and lower spine. Dysfunction in this joint is a common cause of lower back pain.

### How do sacroiliac joint injections work?

#### Treatment
Recommended for lower back pain, these injections contain corticosteroids and local anesthetics for long-term relief.

#### Diagnosis
A local anesthetic is injected, and movements causing pain are tested. A 75% reduction in pain confirms the issue originates from the Sacroiliac joint.

## Provocation Discography

### What is provocation discography?
Provocation discography is an image-guided diagnostic procedure to identify pain sources by recreating the pain.

### How does it work?
A contrast agent is injected into the nucleus of the intervertebral disc to pressurize it, recreating the pain. X-rays are then used to locate and analyze the disc.

---

## How long do the effects of spinal injections last?
- **Permanent relief**: Effects last more than 6 weeks.
- **Temporary relief**: Effects last less than 6 weeks.
- **Series of injections**: Required for significant relief.
- **Recurring pain**: May require another series of injections.

---

## What is the spinal injection procedure?
1. Relaxation medication is administered through an IV line.
2. You lie on your stomach on the X-ray table.
3. The injection site is cleaned and sterilized.
4. A local anesthetic numbs the area.
5. The needle is guided using fluoroscopy or CT imaging.
6. Medication (an anesthetic and corticosteroid) is injected.
