## What is spinal surgery?
Spinal surgery is a procedure that aims at changing the structures in your body for controlling the pain. Some spinal surgeries are considered significant operations, whereas others are minimally invasive procedures.

Spinal surgery is the last option for the treatment of lower back pain and is usually recommended after all non-surgical treatments have been ineffective. The cause of the pain is attributed to some mechanical problems in the spinal column.

Only 20-40% of spinal surgeries have proven to be effective in the treatment of lower back pain. Despite the high chances of failure, spinal surgery becomes essential in the case of:
- Nerve compression
- Musculoskeletal injuries – injury of the muscles and the skeleton

You should consider spinal surgery only after the following treatments, depending on the cause of your problem for lower back pain, have failed:
- Physical therapy
- Behavior modification
- Low-frequency spinal cord stimulation
- Spinal manipulation and mobilization
- Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation
- Epidural spinal injections
- Nerve block injections
- Dorsal root ganglion stimulation
- Radiofrequency ablation
- Intrathecal pumps
- High-frequency spinal cord stimulation
- Medications

## What type of back pain requires surgery?
If you are experiencing back pain because of any of the following, you may need spinal surgery:
- **Herniated or ruptured discs** – In this condition, the soft core of a spinal disc slips out. A slipped disc is the cause of back pain in 1-5% of all lower back pain problems.
- **Spondylolisthesis** – In this condition, a bone in the lower portion of the spine slips onto the bone beneath it. Spondylolisthesis affects 0.53% of people worldwide.
- **Degenerative disk disease (DDD)** – With aging, the discs between the vertebrae get damaged. DDD affects 5.5% of people worldwide.
- **Spinal stenosis** – In this condition, the spaces within your spine narrow. About 1.41% of people worldwide are affected by spinal stenosis and its consequences.
- **Vertebral fractures** – This may happen because of an injury or trauma.

Some of the other infrequent causes that may clinically manifest in the form of back pain include:
- Infection
- Tumor
- **Cauda Equina Syndrome**: In this condition, the bundle of nerves below the spinal cord (cauda equina) gets damaged. It is the cause of about 2-6% of spinal surgeries. However, it is a rare disease:  
  - Worst case scenario: 1 in 33,000 people  
  - Best case scenario: 1 in 100,000 people  

Studies have shown that problems in the spine are the leading cause of lower back pain (LBP), raising the need for spinal surgery.

| **Source of pain causing lower back pain** | **Rate (%)** |
|--------------------------------------------|--------------|
| Spine                                      | 61.2         |
| No cause found                             | 14.5         |
| Spine with sacroiliac joint                | 6.4          |
| Spine with hip                             | 5.8          |
| Sacroiliac joint                           | 5.3          |
| Hip                                        | 3.9          |
| Spine with hip and sacroiliac joint        | 1.8          |

> **Note:** The sacroiliac joint is the bone structure that links the pelvis and the lower spine.

## What are the different types of back surgery?
The following are the different types of spinal surgery your doctor may recommend depending on the cause and severity of your back pain:

### 1. Spinal Laminectomy
- **Description**: Recommended for spinal stenosis. A small section of the vertebral bone (lamina) is removed to open up the spinal canal and relieve nerve pressure.
- **Duration**: 1 to 3 hours
- **Recommendation**: In the case of Spinal Stenosis
- **Time before good results**: **

### 2. Vertebral Augmentation
- **Description**: A combination of vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty where bone cement is filled into a fractured vertebra to restore height and strength.
- **Duration**: Less than an hour
- **Recommendation**: In the case of fractured vertebra
- **Time before good results**: **

### 3. Microdiscectomy
- **Description**: Removal of herniated or slipped disc material pressing on the nerve root. Often performed with laminectomy for nerve pain like sciatica.
- **Duration**: 1 to 2 hours
- **Recommendation**: In the case of slipped disc
- **Time before good results**: **

### 4. Lateral Lumbar Interbody Fusion (Spinal Fusion)
- **Description**: Joining two or more vertebrae using metal grafts or screws to mimic normal healing of broken bones. It involves a long healing process and may reduce flexibility.
- **Duration**: 2 to 4 hours
- **Recommendation**: In the case of broken bones
- **Time before good results**: **

> **Alert**: Spinal fusion and laminectomy may sometimes be performed together, lasting up to 7 hours. Discuss possible complications with your doctor.

### 5. Foraminotomy
- **Description**: Enlarging spinal foramina to relieve nerve compression caused by intervertebral foramina.
- **Duration**: 1 to 2 hours
- **Recommendation**: In the case of spinal stenosis
- **Time before good results**: **

### 6. Disc Prosthesis (Lumbar Disc Replacement)
- **Description**: Replacement of a damaged disc with an artificial one to restore functionality and movement.
- **Duration**: 2 to 3 hours
- **Recommendation**: In the case of damaged disc replacement
- **Time before good results**: **

### 7. Percutaneous Disc Nucleoplasty
- **Description**: Uses radiofrequency energy to trim a bulging disc by vaporizing tissue through a needle.
- **Duration**: 1 hour
- **Recommendation**: In the case of a bulging disc
- **Time before good results**: **

### Surgery Success Rates and Recovery Period
| **Surgery**                      | **Success Rate (%)** | **Recovery Period**             | **Type of Surgery**  |
|-----------------------------------|-----------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------|
| Spinal Laminectomy                | 70.8                 | 2-4 months (with spinal fusion) | Major                |
| Vertebral Augmentation            | 90                   | 6 weeks                         | Minimally invasive   |
| Microdiscectomy                   | 90-95                | 4-6 weeks                       | Minimally invasive   |
| Lateral Lumbar Interbody Fusion   | 71.9                 | 3-6 months                      | Major                |
| Foraminotomy                      | 72-83                | 6-12 weeks                      | Minimally invasive   |
| Disc Prosthesis                   | 75.9                 | 3 months                        | Major                |
| Percutaneous Disc Nucleoplasty    | 84                   | 8-12 weeks                      | Minimally invasive   |

> **Alert**: Major surgeries involve greater risks; consult your doctor about potential pitfalls.

## Are there any risks of back surgery?
Yes, there are potential risks and complications, including:
- Paralysis and impairment requiring subsequent surgeries
- Infections (1% of cases)
- Loss of back flexibility
- Prolonged healing time
- Deep Venous Thrombosis (blood clots)
- Anesthesia-related problems
- Spinal cord injury
- Implant migration
- Sexual dysfunction
- Transitional syndrome
- Hardware fracture

## How to deal with pain after back surgery – Recovery?
Post-operative pain is common. For pain management, you can use:
- Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs
- Corticosteroids
- Behavioral or psychosocial interventions
- Opioids (use with caution)
- Physiotherapy

> **Alert**: Opioids can be addictive. Multimodal therapies combining behavioral and pharmacological interventions are recommended.

## How to take care of wounds after back surgery?
- **Normal symptoms**: Numbness or pain at the incision site.
- **Consult your doctor if**:  
  - Swelling  
  - Extra fluid drainage  
  - Wound opening up  

### Tips for wound care:
- Keep the incision site dry for at least a week.
- Avoid smoking and alcohol to promote healing.

## How long does the pain last after spinal surgery?
Post-operative pain typically lasts for about 3 days, but it may take weeks for complete recovery.

## Can I still have back pain after surgery?
Yes, back pain may persist due to incomplete recovery or other underlying issues.

### Key takeaway:
Spinal surgery should be seen as a last resort. Before opting for surgery:
- Discuss risks and benefits with your doctor.
- Educate yourself about pre- and post-surgery events.
- Be mentally prepared for slow recovery and possible discomfort.
