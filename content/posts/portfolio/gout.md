# Gout

## What is gout??

Gout is a disease in which pain and inflammation occur in the joints because of a uric acid build-up. It is a symptom of arthritis in which you can experience severe pain, redness, tenderness, and swelling in the joints.  
It usually happens because the extra uric acid accumulates in the form of crystals in the joints. It is a prevalent disease that affects about 1-4% of the world population. While it can affect anyone, men are more likely to develop Gout than women – about 3-6% of men are usually affected by Gout, whereas only 1-2% of the women develop its symptoms.  
Gout attacks are often sudden and start with the big toe giving you a burning sensation in your feet.

## What are the symptoms of Gout?

There are 4 stages of Gout, namely:
- Asymptomatic hyperuricemia
- Acute gouty attack
- Intercritical period
- Chronic tophaceous gout

Each of these stages differs in the associated symptoms. Therefore knowing these symptoms may help you or your doctor in diagnosing the nature of your Gout.

| Stage                          | Characteristics | Symptoms |
|---------------------------------|-----------------|----------|
| **Asymptomatic hyperuricemia**  | Generally caused by the inability of the kidneys to excrete excess uric acid | No symptoms or signs |
| **Acute Gout Attack**           | - Monoarthritic: Inflammation of one joint (generally the big toe) <br> - Other areas at risk: <br>   * Tarsal joints <br>   * Metatarsal joints <br>   * Ankle joints <br>   * Knee joints <br>   * Wrist joints <br>   * Joints of the hand (e.g., metacarpophalangeal joints, interphalangeal joints) <br>   * Hip (rare) <br>   * Shoulder (rare) <br>   * Vertebral column (very rare) <br> - Soft tissue inflammation may occur: <br>   * Olecranon bursitis <br>   * Achilles tendonitis | Inflammation in joints causing: <br> - Redness <br> - Hotness <br> - Swelling <br> - Loss of function <br> For large joints like knees and ankles, it is highly likely that there are no visible signs on the skin; however, the swelling and the pain can be extreme. |
| **Intercritical Period**        | This is the remission period and may start within hours or days after the acute attack settles down | No symptoms; however, new attacks may come in. |
| **Chronic tophaceous gout**     | Gout may become chronic if overlooked. Crystals accumulate in the form of large masses (called tophus) around: <br> - Ear joints <br> - Under the skin tissue | - Swelling where tophus is present <br> - Warmth and tenderness at the site of the tophus <br> - Difficulty in using the joint after the attack stops <br> - Severe pain in the joint after the attack starts <br> - Loss of range of motion in the affected joints |

Note: Arthritis in more than one joint is common and is usually associated with long-term untreated gout or in the case of menopausal women. In these cases, you may experience:
- Fever
- Headache
- Malaise

In such cases, until proven otherwise, the gout is treated as a symptom of septic arthritis.

## What is the main cause of Gout?

When the uric acid in your body increases above an average threshold level, it leads to the deposition of urate crystals under the tissue and in your joints. The accumulation of urate crystals could lead to a Gout attack and the associated pain and inflammation.  
Note: When uric acid is ionized, it causes the formation of uric acid.

The urate levels in the body depend on:
- Height
- Weight
- Blood pressure
- Renal function
- Gender
- Alcohol consumption

Here are the normal levels of uric acid in blood for different groups of people:

| Group             | Normal Levels of Uric Acid in Blood |
|-------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Adult Male        | 4.0-8.5 mg/dL                      |
| Adult Female      | 2.7-7.3 mg/dL                      |
| Elderly           | Only a slight increase from the value taken at a younger age |
| Child             | 2.5-5.5 mg/dL                      |
| Newborn           | 2.0-6.2 mg/dL                      |

The uric acid levels in your blood increase because of the following two main factors:
1. Overproduction – 10% of the cases – excessive production of uric acid
2. Underexcretion – 90% of the cases – the inability of the body to get rid of the uric acid

The factors that lead to overproduction or underexcretion are:

| Overproduction of Uric Acid – Causes   | Underexcretion – Causes |
|----------------------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Purine-rich diet**:                  | **Urinary excretion**:  |
| - Meat (beef, pork, lamb)              | - Diuretics (medication to increase the rate of urinary excretion) |
| - Seafood (Tuna, codfish)              | - Kidney failure        |
| - Beer                                 | **Urinary reabsorption**: |
| **Endogenous purine synthesis**:       | - Alcohol               |
| - Malignancy                           | - Genetic defects       |
| - Tumor lysis syndrome (when tumor cells excrete their contents into the blood) | |
| **Purine salvage**:                    |                         |
| - HGPRT deficiency (causes Lesch-Nyhan syndrome) |                         |
| - PRPS deficiency (causes hyperuricemia) |                         |
| **Purine breakdown**:                  |                         |
| - Glycogen storage disease (metabolic disease that can cause hyperuricemia) |                         |

The average threshold of uric acid beyond which there is a risk of developing Gout or beyond which hyperuricemia may start is 6.8 mg/dL.

## What is the best doctor to see for gout?

In case you are noticing the symptoms of Gout, you would need to see one of the following doctors depending on your symptoms and underlying cause:
- Rheumatologists
- Internists
- General Practitioners
- Orthopedists
- Nephrologist

## How is Gout Diagnosed?

**Joint Aspiration**: Also known as Arthrocentesis, theoretically, this is the primary approach for the diagnosis of Gout. In Joint Aspiration, synovial fluid from your joint capsule is extracted with the help of a syringe to test for urate crystals.  
Note: Synovial fluid is the fluid found between the bones of your joints.  
However, practically, only in about 11% of the cases, this test is the first recommendation.

Following are some of the tests that are generally recommended and associated observations that may indicate that you are suffering from Gout:

| Test                              | Result |
|-----------------------------------|--------|
| **Serum Urate Concentration**     | If the levels decrease, it may indicate an acute attack |
| **Renal Function**                | If renal failure happens, it may indicate hyperuricemia |
| **Urinary urate excretion**       | May suggest increased uric acid in the urine which causes gout |
| **Full blood count**              | Increased white blood cells may indicate septic arthritis |
| **Fasting lipids, glucose, and thyroid function** | Can help in diagnosing diabetes, hyperlipidemia, hypothyroidism, and hyperthyroidism – these are associated with gout hence may lead to a diagnosis |

In some cases, despite showing symptoms of gout, you may not show any of the results mentioned above. Hence, it is highly likely that if your healthcare provider suspects gout, they may treat you as if you had gout to avoid the risks that come up when gout is overlooked.  
Note: If a patient is suffering from pseudogout or any other type of inflammatory arthritis and the doctor suspects a possible case of gout for you and recommends the treatment for it, then it is generally considered safe.  
The most important and definite diagnosis of gout is the identification of septic arthritis.  

**Alert**: If septic arthritis is identified or suspected, chances are high, your doctor will recommend immediate joint aspiration to confirm the diagnosis.

## What is the best treatment for Gout?

There are many possible treatments for the cure and management of Gout. The treatment that your doctor will recommend if you suffer from Gout will depend on a risk-benefit analysis based on your health.  

**Alert**: You should not ignore Gout as it could lead to long-term arthritis and deformity and permanent lack of motion.

### Best medicines for the treatment of Gout that are generally recommended:
1. Non-Steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs like Indometacin
2. Steroids and adrenocorticotrophic hormone
3. Colchicine

### Best medication for the prevention of Gout:
1. Xanthine oxidase inhibitors like Allopurinol and Febuxostat
2. Colchicine
3. Uricosurics like sulfinpyrazone
4. Losartan
5. Flubiprofen

### Surgery
1. **Tophi removal surgery**: 12-35% of the patients suffering from Gout develop Tophi, and it can cause a lot of pain and inflammation. In the advanced stages of Gout, tophi surround the joints, tendons, or bursae (fluid-filled sac around the joint). If these crystals break, it can lead to severe infection. Your doctor may recommend surgery to remove Tophi if the swelling caused because of the inflammation doesn’t decrease with medicinal treatments.
2. **Joint fusion surgery**: This is recommended in advanced cases of Gout wherein the joint has been deformed and/or damaged to a large extent, thereby making movement extremely difficult. In Joint Fusion Surgery, smaller bones are fused to regain the functioning of the joints and to decrease the pain.
3. **Joint replacement surgery**: This surgery is also recommended to alleviate the pain caused by advanced cases of tophi. In this surgery, an artificial joint is used as a replacement to decrease the pain and regain the lost range of motion.

### Home Remedies for the management of gout-related pain
1. Ice pack on the affected area
2. Rest
3. Strong analgesics
4. Losing weight
5. Avoid beer
6. Reduced consumption of meat

## Who is most at risk for Gout?

You are at a high risk of developing Gout if you lie in any of the following categories:
- Heavy alcohol drinker
- Postmenopausal Woman
- Continually suffering from high blood pressure
- Constantly dehydrated
- Suffering from Degenerative arthritis
- Under certain medications like Niacin, Levodopa, Diuretics, and drugs that contain Salicylate
- Consume a diet that contains food items high in purines like:
  - Kinds of seafood such as tuna, codfish, sardines, and herring
  - Red meat
  - Ducks
  - Organ meat like kidney and liver

Note: When the body breaks down purines, it leads to the production of uric acid.

- Overweight or obesity: Body Mass Index > 28
  - Calculate your BMI at home:
    - It’s a simple mathematical calculation:  
      Your Body Mass Index = Your weight (Kg) / Square of your height (m²)
- Family history of gout
- Surgery or any kind of trauma
- Smoking

Anything that increases the uric acid levels in the body puts you at risk of getting gout. All of the above-mentioned risk factors could lead to an increase in uric acid in your body and, therefore, must be avoided.

Note: The people who fall in the following category are at the highest risk of experiencing gout:
1. **Gender**: Male
2. **Age**: Greater than 50
3. **Obese**

## Can Gout be prevented?

Yes, in most cases, you can prevent Gout unless it is hereditary in the family. The goal is to avoid doing things that may increase the uric acid levels in your body. Following are some of the steps you can take to put a stop to the factors that may be increasing your chances of getting gout:

- **Exercise and physical activity**: If you are already obese, this can help you in decreasing the weight. However, if you are not overweight, regular exercise can prevent obesity in the future. This is highly important because if you are overweight, your body will produce more uric acid than usual, and your kidneys won’t be able to discard the extra uric acid. Regular exercise can help you maintain a healthy weight and therefore prevent gout and numerous other diseases that are associated with obesity.

Some of the exercises you can do at home to avoid obesity include:
- Full Burpee – 15 a day
- Half Burpee – 30 a day
- Jumping Jacks – 50 a day
- High Knee Jumps – 50 a day
- Mountain Climbers – 100 a day
- Rope skipping – 100 a day
- Jumping Lunges – 45 a day

Note: The number of repetitions per exercise mentioned above is an average figure and can vary across individuals. The goal should be that you should burn some of the extra calories. If you can do more, you should; if you can do less than what is mentioned above, try to work your way to these numbers.

**Alert**: In case you have other health conditions like low back pain, consult your physician before you start exercising.

- **Healthy Diet**: An adequately planned diet will not only ensure you have an optimum weight but will also keep a check on the rising uric acid levels.

Some of the additions or reductions you can make to your diet include:

| Include in your diet     | Remove or reduce in your diet  |
|--------------------------|--------------------------------|
| Citrus fruits like oranges and pineapples | Red meat |
| Coffee                   | Codfish                        |
| Low-fat milk             | Tuna                           |
| Nuts and seeds           | Mushroom                      |
| Yogurt                   | Bacon                          |
| Water                    | Liver                          |
| Wine                     | Beer                           |
|                          | Alcoholic Beverages            |
|                          | Soda                           |

Note: You don’t need to avoid purine-rich foods like red meat or tuna fish completely; however, do take them only in moderation.

**Alert**: Try to avoid fasting for weight reduction as that may temporarily increase the uric acid levels.

## Key Takeaways:
1. Moderate consumption of alcohol
2. Drink lots of water – at least 4 liters
3. Use diet and exercise to reduce weight
4. Citrus fruits high in Vitamin C – at least 500 mg per day
5. Maintain a healthy body weight
6. Look for substitutes like wine instead of beer

## Can you permanently cure Gout?

No, Gout cannot be treated permanently, however, the associated pain and other symptoms can be managed.
