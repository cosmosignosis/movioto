# Gout

## What is gout?
Gout is a disease in which pain and inflammation occur in the joints because of a uric acid build-up. It is a symptom of arthritis in which you can experience severe pain, redness, tenderness, and swelling in the joints. It usually happens because the extra uric acid accumulates in the form of crystals in the joints. It is a prevalent disease that affects about 1-4% of the world population. While it can affect anyone, men are more likely to develop gout than women – about 3-6% of men are usually affected by gout, whereas only 1-2% of women develop its symptoms. Gout attacks are often sudden and start with the big toe giving you a burning sensation in your feet.

## What are the symptoms of Gout?
There are 4 stages of Gout, namely:
- Asymptomatic hyperuricemia
- Acute gouty attack
- Intercritical period
- Chronic tophaceous gout

Each of these stages differs in the associated symptoms. Therefore knowing these symptoms may help you or your doctor in diagnosing the nature of your Gout.

| Stage                         | Characteristics                                                                                             | Symptoms                                                                                               |
|-------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Asymptomatic hyperuricemia    | Generally caused by the inability of the kidneys to excrete excess uric acid                                 | No symptoms or signs                                                                                    |
| Acute Gout Attack              | - Monoarthritic - Inflammation of one joint – Generally the big toe<br>- Other areas at risk:<br>  - Tarsal joints<br>  - Metatarsal joints<br>  - Ankles joints<br>  - Knees joints<br>  - Wrists joints<br>  - Joints of the hand like metacarpophalangeal joints and interphalangeal joints<br>  - Hip – rare<br>  - Shoulder – rare<br>  - Vertebral column – very rare<br>- Soft tissue inflammation may occur<br>- Olecranon bursitis and Achilles tendonitis | Inflammation in joints causing:<br>- Redness<br>- Hotness<br>- Swelling<br>- Loss of function         |
| Intercritical Period           | This is the remission period and may start within hours or days after the acute attack settles down         | Generally, there are no signs and symptoms; however, new attacks – recurrent gout - may intervene with the remission period if the previous stages like hyperuricemia were not treated properly |
| Chronic tophaceous gout        | Gout may become chronic if overlooked                                                                         | Crystals accumulate in the form of large mass (called tophus) around:<br>- Ear Joints<br>- Under the skin tissue<br>Can lead to:<br>- Destruction of the joints<br>- Deformity in the joints<br>Possibility of bone erosions if tophus extends and rubs against the bones |

**Note:** Arthritis in more than one joint is common and is usually associated with long-term untreated gout or in the case of menopausal women. In these cases, you may experience:
- Fever
- Headache
- Malaise

In such cases, until proven otherwise, gout is treated as a symptom of septic arthritis.

## What is the main cause of Gout?
When the uric acid in your body increases above an average threshold level, it leads to the deposition of urate crystals under the tissue and in your joints. The accumulation of urate crystals could lead to a Gout attack and the associated pain and inflammation.

**Note:** When uric acid is ionized, it causes the formation of uric acid.

The urate levels in the body depend on:
- Height
- Weight
- Blood pressure
- Renal function
- Gender
- Alcohol consumption

Here are the normal levels of uric acid in blood for different groups of people:

| Group        | Uric Acid Level (mg/dL) |
|--------------|--------------------------|
| Adult Male   | 4.0-8.5                  |
| Adult Female | 2.7-7.3                  |
| Elderly      | Only a slight increase from the value taken at a younger age |
| Child        | 2.5-5.5                  |
| Newborn      | 2.0-6.2                  |

The uric acid levels in your blood increase because of two main factors:
1. Overproduction – 10% of cases – excessive production of uric acid
2. Underexcretion – 90% of cases – inability of the body to get rid of uric acid

The factors that lead to overproduction or underexcretion are:

**Overproduction of Uric Acid Causes:**
- Purine-rich diet: 
  - Meat (beef, pork, lamb)
  - Seafood (tuna, codfish)
  - Beer
- Endogenous purine synthesis:
  - Malignancy
  - Tumor lysis syndrome – when tumor cells excrete their contents into the blood
- Purine salvage:
  - HGPRT deficiency – causes Lesch-Nyhan syndrome
  - PRPS deficiency – causes hyperuricemia
- Purine breakdown:
  - Glycogen storage disease – is a metabolic disease that can onset hyperuricemia

**Underexcretion Causes:**
- Urinary excretion:
  - Diuretics – medication to increase urinary excretion rate
  - Kidney failure
- Urinary reabsorption:
  - Alcohol
  - Genetic defects

The average threshold of uric acid beyond which there is a risk of developing Gout or beyond which hyperuricemia may start is **6.8 mg/dL**.

## What is the best doctor to see for gout?
In case you are noticing symptoms of Gout, you would need to see one of the following doctors depending on your symptoms and underlying cause:
- Rheumatologists
- Internists
- General Practitioners
- Orthopedists
- Nephrologist

## How is Gout Diagnosed?
**Joint Aspiration:** Also known as Arthrocentesis, theoretically, this is the primary approach for diagnosing Gout. In Joint Aspiration, synovial fluid from your joint capsule is extracted with a syringe to test for urate crystals.

**Note:** Synovial fluid is found between the bones of your joints.

However, practically only about **11%** of cases recommend this test first.

Following are some tests that are generally recommended along with observations that may indicate that you are suffering from Gout:

| Test                           | Result                                                                                       |
|--------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Serum Urate Concentration      | If levels decrease it may indicate an acute attack                                           |
| Renal Function                 | If renal failure happens, it may indicate hyperuricaemia                                    |
| Urinary urate excretion        | May suggest increased uric acid in urine which causes gout                                   |
| Full blood count               | Increased white blood cells may indicate septic arthritis                                     |
| Fasting lipids, glucose, thyroid function | Can help diagnose diabetes, hyperlipidaemia hypothyroidism, and hyperthyroidism – associated with gout |

In some cases, despite showing symptoms of gout, you may not show any results mentioned above. Hence, if your healthcare provider suspects gout, they may treat you as if you had it to avoid risks associated with overlooking it.

**Note:** If a patient suffers from pseudogout or any other type of inflammatory arthritis and their doctor suspects possible gout for them and recommends treatment for it, then it is generally considered safe.

The most important and definite diagnosis of gout is identifying septic arthritis.

**Alert:** If septic arthritis is identified or suspected, chances are high that your doctor will recommend immediate joint aspiration to confirm diagnosis.

## What is the best treatment for Gout?
There are many possible treatments for curing and managing Gout. The treatment that your doctor will recommend will depend on a risk-benefit analysis based on your health.

**Alert:** You should not ignore Gout as it could lead to long-term arthritis and deformity as well as permanent lack of motion.

### Best medicines for treating Gout:
1. Non-Steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs like Indometacin
2. Steroids and adrenocorticotrophic hormone 
3. Colchicine

### Best medication for preventing Gout:
1. Xanthine oxidase inhibitors like Allopurinol and Febuxostat
2. Colchicine
3. Uricosurics like sulfinpyrazone
4. Losartan
5. Flubiprofen

### Surgery:
1. **Tophi removal surgery:** About **12-35%** of patients suffering from Gout develop Tophi which can cause significant pain and inflammation.
2. **Joint fusion surgery:** Recommended in advanced cases where joints have been deformed or damaged.
3. **Joint replacement surgery:** Recommended to alleviate pain caused by advanced cases of Tophi using an artificial joint as a replacement.

### Home Remedies for managing gout-related pain:
1. Ice pack on affected area
2. Rest
3. Strong analgesics
4. Losing weight
5. Avoid beer
6. Reduced consumption of meat

## Who is most at risk for Gout?
You are at high risk for developing Gout if you lie in any following categories:
- Heavy alcohol drinker
- Postmenopausal woman
- Continually suffering from high blood pressure
- Constantly dehydrated
- Suffering from degenerative arthritis
- Under certain medications like Niacin, Levodopa, Diuretics and drugs containing Salicylate 
- Consume a diet high in purines such as seafood (tuna, codfish), red meat, ducks, organ meat (kidney and liver)

**Note:** When breaking down purines leads to uric acid production.

### Additional Risk Factors:
1. Overweight or obesity: Body Mass Index > **28**
   - Calculate your BMI at home: Your Body Mass Index = Your weight (Kg)/Square of your height (m²)
2. Family history of gout 
3. Surgery or trauma 
4. Smoking 

Anything that increases uric acid levels puts you at risk for getting gout.

**Note:** The highest risk categories include:
1. Gender: Male 
2. Age: Greater than **50**
3. Obese 

## Can Gout be prevented?
Yes, in most cases you can prevent Gout unless it’s hereditary in your family. The goal is to avoid activities that may increase uric acid levels.

### Steps to Prevent Gout:
1. **Exercise and Physical Activity:** Helps decrease weight; regular exercise can prevent obesity.
   - Suggested exercises include Full Burpee (15/day), Half Burpee (30/day), Jumping Jacks (50/day), etc.
   
   **Note:** Adjust repetitions based on individual capability.
   
   **Alert:** Consult your physician before starting exercises if you have other health conditions like low back pain.

2. **Healthy Diet:** An adequately planned diet helps maintain optimum weight while controlling rising uric acid levels.
   
   **Include:**
   - Citrus fruits like oranges and pineapples 
   - Coffee 
   - Low-fat milk 
   - Nuts and seeds 
   - Yogurt 
   - Water 
   - Wine 

   **Remove/Reduce:**
   - Red meat 
   - Codfish 
   - Tuna 
   - Mushroom 
   - Bacon 
   - Liver 
   - Beer 
   - Alcoholic beverages 
   - Soda 

**Note:** Do not avoid purine-rich foods completely; consume them only in moderation.

**Alert:** Avoid fasting for weight reduction as it may temporarily increase uric acid levels.

## Key Takeaways:
1. Moderate alcohol consumption.
2. Drink lots of water – at least **4 liters**.
3. Use diet and exercise to reduce weight.
4. Consume citrus fruits high in Vitamin C – at least **500 mg per day**.
5. Maintain a healthy body weight.
6. Look for substitutes like wine instead of beer.

## Can you permanently cure Gout?
No, Gout cannot be treated permanently; however, associated pain and other symptoms can be managed.
