# Gout

## What is Gout?

Gout is a disease in which pain and inflammation occur in the joints because of a uric acid build-up. It is a symptom of arthritis in which you can experience severe pain, redness, tenderness, and swelling in the joints.

It usually happens because the extra uric acid accumulates in the form of crystals in the joints. It is a prevalent disease that affects about 1–4% of the world population. While it can affect anyone, men are more likely to develop Gout than women—about 3–6% of men are usually affected by Gout, whereas only 1–2% of women develop its symptoms.

Gout attacks are often sudden and start with the big toe, giving you a burning sensation in your feet.

## What are the symptoms of Gout?

There are 4 stages of Gout, namely:

- Asymptomatic hyperuricemia
- Acute gouty attack
- Intercritical period
- Chronic tophaceous gout

Each of these stages differs in the associated symptoms. Therefore, knowing these symptoms may help you or your doctor in diagnosing the nature of your Gout.

| Stage                  | Characteristics                                                                                                                   | Symptoms                                                                                                                                             |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Asymptomatic hyperuricemia** | Generally caused by the inability of the kidneys to excrete excess uric acid                                                     | No symptoms or signs                                                                                                                                |
| **Acute Gout Attack**         | - Monoarthritic: Inflammation of one joint (usually the big toe)                                                                 <br> - Other areas at risk: <br>   - Tarsal joints<br>   - Metatarsal joints<br>   - Ankle joints<br>   - Knee joints<br>   - Wrist joints<br>   - Hand joints<br>   - Hip (rare)<br>   - Shoulder (rare)<br>   - Vertebral column (very rare)<br>- Soft tissue inflammation<br>   - Olecranon bursitis<br>   - Achilles tendonitis | Inflammation in joints causing:<br>- Redness<br>- Hotness<br>- Swelling<br>- Loss of function<br><br> For larger joints (like knees/ankles), visible signs may be absent, but swelling and pain can be extreme. |
| **Intercritical Period**      | This is the remission period and may start within hours or days after the acute attack settles down.                         | No symptoms; however, new attacks may come in.                                                                                                       |
| **Chronic tophaceous gout**   | - Gout may become chronic if overlooked.<br>- Crystals accumulate as large masses (**tophus**) around:<br>   - Ear joints<br>   - Under skin tissue<br><br>- Can lead to joint destruction, deformity, or bone erosions. | - Swelling where tophus is present<br>- Warmth and tenderness at the tophus site<br>- Severe joint pain during attacks<br>- Loss of joint motion<br>- Difficulty using the joint post-attack |

**Note:** Arthritis in more than one joint is common in long-term untreated gout or menopausal women. In these cases, you may experience:

- Fever
- Headache
- Malaise

In such cases, until proven otherwise, the gout is treated as a symptom of septic arthritis.

## What is the main cause of Gout?

When uric acid in your body increases above an average threshold level, it leads to the deposition of urate crystals under the tissue and in your joints. This accumulation can cause Gout attacks along with pain and inflammation.

**Uric Acid Levels by Group:**

| Group            | Normal Uric Acid Levels (mg/dL) |
|-------------------|---------------------------------|
| Adult Male       | 4.0–8.5                        |
| Adult Female     | 2.7–7.3                        |
| Elderly          | Slightly increased             |
| Child            | 2.5–5.5                        |
| Newborn          | 2.0–6.2                        |

**Main Causes of Increased Uric Acid:**

1. **Overproduction** (10% of cases):
   - Purine-rich diet (e.g., meat, seafood, beer)
   - Malignancy
   - Glycogen storage diseases
   - Enzyme deficiencies (HGPRT, PRPS)

2. **Underexcretion** (90% of cases):
   - Diuretics
   - Kidney failure
   - Alcohol

**Threshold for Risk:** Uric acid levels > 6.8 mg/dL increase Gout risk.

## What is the best doctor to see for Gout?

If you notice symptoms of Gout, consult one of the following specialists:

- Rheumatologists
- Internists
- General Practitioners
- Orthopedists
- Nephrologists

## How is Gout Diagnosed?

1. **Joint Aspiration**: Synovial fluid is extracted to test for urate crystals.
2. **Other Diagnostic Tests:**

| Test                            | Result                                                                 |
|--------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Serum Urate Concentration      | Decrease may indicate acute attack                                    |
| Renal Function                 | Indicates hyperuricemia if renal failure occurs                       |
| Urinary urate excretion        | Suggests increased uric acid in urine                                 |
| Full blood count               | Increased WBCs may indicate septic arthritis                         |
| Fasting lipids/glucose/thyroid | Diagnoses diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and thyroid-related conditions    |

2. **Medicines for Prevention:**
   - Xanthine oxidase inhibitors (e.g., Allopurinol, Febuxostat)
