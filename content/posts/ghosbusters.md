2024 is set to be a great year for the genre as fans await some of the most promising releases this year. Some of these releases are reboots like Dune2, Alien: Romulus, sonic the hedgehog3 and come with a respectable legacy and others are new creations like spaceman and The electric state.
One film that has stood the test of time is Ghostbusters. The franchise has one of the most loyal fanbase and they have received plenty of sequels and reboots. But not all reboots are created equal. As we come close to the release of the latest instalment in the franchise, lets take a look at the best and the worst that the ghostbuster franchise has to offer


## 1. Ghostbuster answer the call - 2016

![2016](/img/02/03RebootGhostbusters2016.png "2016-4")  

In 2009 fans were introduced to the much awaited reboot ghosbuster answer the call. As expected, large portion of the franchises' fans were not thrilled with what they saw.

-- offers nothing new from 1984 movie, not very funny, it is a reboot doesnt acknowledge the events of the last movie- brand new movie with a brand new continuity- how to judge a reboot- does it improve upon the original, does it add anyting good to the franchise, is there a reason for this reboot to exist beyond earning a lot of money on a well established name or brand, thats how i view a reboots because most of the time they are nowhere near as good as the original, there are a handful that are better like ocean11, john carpenters the thing- and with this ghostbusters there are only a handful of things that I could find that are actually better and improved upon from the 1984 film - one of them being chris hemsworth as the receptionist he had more screen time than the original ghostbuster receptionist, he was funnier , he had more things to do, he actually added something to the movie,  not like the original receptionist character'.... and due to advnacements in tehcnoklogy that happened over the past 30years,  or so the action sequences have improved as well so technically this film is an improvement over the original in regards to how its constructed from sound design and visuals. does that really matter though when your film is 30 years older and thosethings are  just going to happen naturally as technology progresses, there are very few improvements in this film in comparison to the original 1984 film and thats sad because the director usually makes good movies that being said it doesnt come even close to deserving the amount of hate that its gotten,  it is not a dargaon ball evolition,  its not a last airbender, its just not that great unfortunately,  and its nowhere near as good as that orginal ghostbusters film but i do think its better than ghostbnuster 2 ---and much of that is due to the excellent chemistry present between these 4 girls , mcarthy and wig these two work marvelously with each other and i think wig is really funny she is a really good improvisational comedian as is mcarthy- these girls work really well with each other and mckanon is on and offfor me. she playued a sort of a crazy person and i could tellthat she is really funny but her character and not necessarily her as an actress just didnt quite always work for me but those 4 as a team did have really good chemnistry,  with one another and notice that i have been saying that all of these actreeses are really fuinny because i do think all these actresses are rteally funny not just that much in this movie.- a lot of it was because of the script. it seemed like it was trying too much to recreate certain elements of the original as well as bringing back some very unfortuntely unnecessary cameos in roles that were almost disrespectful to the original in particular one person who plays a scientist in thisfilm and i was like not only is this not funny,  but this isnt really respecting the origninal really por choiceswere made with those cameos that did not just work forthis movie. This movie is really a mixed bag for me because with all of the whole youre a misogynistic if you hate this movie thing its tough to really go  about revioewing this movie withouyt being labelled somehting a simple fact of the matter is  i like all these actreses i justr didnt like this movie it wasnt very funny so its tough to traverse this next thing  i wanna talk about every male character in this movie is either a idiot, a coward,  or an asshole,  and its pretty unprecedented  i actually couldnt think of one  male character that wasnt one of those three things, also the final resolution of this movie involves another hit at men,  to put this in a nuthseell,. the cameos didnt really need to be there,  4 leads are funny and i would like to see them in a funnier movie, hemsworth had some really funny parts,  therea are funny scenes,  there are momenmts where i laughed,  but overall it suffers when you compare it to the original which its trying toearase,  and when you take reboots as  a whole as a  thing there really is  no point to reboot the film if you  cant improve upon it because if you are not improving upon it then what are you doing  hopingf for some bank -C grade - doesnt quite deserve that hate but its also not a good enough film to get audienecs excited it was just kind of okay.

All great franchises have that one duckling that gets the most hate. And for the Ghostbuster franchise it was Ghostbuster: answer the call. 
A large portion of the fanbase hated ghoshbuster answer the call. The weak plot and writing was one of the biggest reasons for a lot of this hate. Some fans however said that the action sequences were good if only they had worked on the writing specifically on the comedy aspect of the script and not relied completely on improve the movie could have been better. One consistent problem that the fans of this franchise have with ghosbuster reboots and sequels is that every new instalment tries to emulate ghostbuster1 without offering anything new and ghostbuster answer the call received similar remakrs. However even with numerous unhappy fans some still liked the all female cast,especially the chemistry between Mccarthy and wig and some even appreciated the increased screen time of the receptionist played by Chris Hemsworth.

## 2. Ghostbuster2 - 1989

![1989](/img/02/02ghostbustersii1989.png "1989-3")  

In 1989 fans were introduced to the first sequel of the franchise Ghostbusters2. As is generally the case with sequels some of the fans were not happy with what they saw.  While some say it <insert some good aspect> most fans were not as sympathetic. 
The film was heavily criticised for just being a recreation of the original with certain elements just twisted around slightly. The fans also didn’t like the fact that the sequel completely invalidated the first movie by acting as if the events of the fist movie didn’t happen. There is nothing particularly wrong with the movie its just that the movie has nothing new which made it just a poor imitation of the first one and is therefore remembered just as a retread of the first movie.; The movies follows the same beats as the first movie and even copied a lot of the key points making it just a retelling of the first movie. Many fans have stated that the movie seemed to be forcing a story. However a lot of the fans did appreiciate the introduction of the new themes of brotherhood and human spirit and loved the character development and the soundtrack.

## 3. Ghostbuster: Afterlife - 2021

![2021](/img/02/4GhostbustersAfterlife2021.png "2021-2")  

After the failure of ghostbuster Answer the call and addition of Paul Rudd to the cast, fans were intrigued by the 2021 film Ghosterbuster Afterlife and were hoping for something great. And while it was surely an improvement over Ghostbuster2 and Answer the call, some fans were less than impressed. Even though there is not a lot of hate towards it, not like answer the call but it still received criticism. Some mentioned that the second half was pretty much a reharsh of Ghostbuster1 along with no mention of the Ghostbuster2. The movie seemed to be a bit of a fan service but since the fan service didn’t get in the way of the story fans appreciated it. The movie also had a bit of unnecessary nostalgia to the point that it seemed the movie couldn’t stand on its own without constantly going back to the classic. However, its not the worst filmthe action sequences are exciting and there are new characters that were developed properly. It has some new and some old elements in it which is good.

## 4. Ghostbuster1 - 1984

![1984](/img/02/01OriginalseriesGhostbusters1984.png "1984-1")  

As the franchise’s first moie Ghostbuster1 was a great success upon its released. The movie got a lot of attention and is considered one of the landmark sci-fi comedy horror movies in the minds of the many fans of the series and genre. It was the perfect blend of comedic writing and genre horror elements which is often done poorly but this one catches lightning in a bottle. Fans also loved the interaction between characters. As opposed to other movies of the sci fi genere where the plots are incredibly mind bending and deep this one was super simple just gour sorta regular guiys saving the day and becoming heroes with the whole theatre cheering them – not incredibly deeo but the story was executed poerfeclty and it ended up being one of the most loved movies of the genre.
