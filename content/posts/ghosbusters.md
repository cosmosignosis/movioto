2024 is set to be a great year for the genre as fans await some of the most promising releases this year. Some of these releases are reboots like Dune2, Alien: Romulus, sonic the hedgehog3 and come with a respectable legacy and others are new creations like spaceman and The electric state.
One film that has stood the test of time is Ghostbusters. The franchise has one of the most loyal fanbase and they have received plenty of sequels and reboots. But not all reboots are created equal. As we come close to the release of the latest instalment in the franchise, lets take a look at the best and the worst that the ghostbuster franchise has to offer


## 1. Ghostbuster answer the call - 2016

All great franchises have that one duckling that gets the most hate. And for the Ghostbuster franchise it was Ghostbuster: answer the call. 
A large portion of the fanbase hated ghoshbuster answer the call. The weak plot and writing was one of the biggest reasons for a lot of this hate. Some fans however said that the action sequences were good if only they had worked on the writing specifically on the comedy aspect of the script and not relied completely on improve the movie could have been better. One consistent problem that the fans of this franchise have with ghosbuster reboots and sequels is that every new instalment tries to emulate ghostbuster1 without offering anything new and ghostbuster answer the call received similar remakrs. However even with numerous unhappy fans some still liked the all female cast,especially the chemistry between Mccarthy and wig and some even appreciated the increased screen time of the receptionist played by Chris Hemsworth.

## 2. Ghostbuster2 - 1989

In 1989 fans were introduced to the first sequel of the franchise Ghostbusters2. As is generally the case with sequels some of the fans were not happy with what they saw.  While some say it <insert some good aspect> most fans were not as sympathetic. 
The film was heavily criticised for just being a recreation of the original with certain elements just twisted around slightly. The fans also didn’t like the fact that the sequel completely invalidated the first movie by acting as if the events of the fist movie didn’t happen. There is nothing particularly wrong with the movie its just that the movie has nothing new which made it just a poor imitation of the first one and is therefore remembered just as a retread of the first movie.; The movies follows the same beats as the first movie and even copied a lot of the key points making it just a retelling of the first movie. Many fans have stated that the movie seemed to be forcing a story. However a lot of the fans did appreiciate the introduction of the new themes of brotherhood and human spirit and loved the character development and the soundtrack.

## 3. Ghostbuster: Afterlife - 2021

After the failure of ghostbuster Answer the call and addition of Paul Rudd to the cast, fans were intrigued by the 2021 film Ghosterbuster Afterlife and were hoping for something great. And while it was surely an improvement over Ghostbuster2 and Answer the call, some fans were less than impressed. Even though there is not a lot of hate towards it, not like answer the call but it still received criticism. Some mentioned that the second half was pretty much a reharsh of Ghostbuster1 along with no mention of the Ghostbuster2. The movie seemed to be a bit of a fan service but since the fan service didn’t get in the way of the story fans appreciated it. The movie also had a bit of unnecessary nostalgia to the point that it seemed the movie couldn’t stand on its own without constantly going back to the classic. However, its not the worst filmthe action sequences are exciting and there are new characters that were developed properly. It has some new and some old elements in it which is good.

## 4. Ghostbuster1 - 1984

As the franchise’s first moie Ghostbuster1 was a great success upon its released. The movie got a lot of attention and is considered one of the landmark sci-fi comedy horror movies in the minds of the many fans of the series and genre. It was the perfect blend of comedic writing and genre horror elements which is often done poorly but this one catches lightning in a bottle. Fans also loved the interaction between characters. As opposed to other movies of the sci fi genere where the plots are incredibly mind bending and deep this one was super simple just gour sorta regular guiys saving the day and becoming heroes with the whole theatre cheering them – not incredibly deeo but the story was executed poerfeclty and it ended up being one of the most loved movies of the genre.
