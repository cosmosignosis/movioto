Good literature inspires good cinema! That's true for many genres but moreso for the sciene fiction. Many great sci-fi movies like The Martian or Arrival could trace their success back to great books. It's also a safe bet for studios since they are investing in stories that already have a eager fanbase. However, adapting science fiction literature to the big screen can be one of the most dauting tasks a director can take up. They need to meet the expectations of the fans, find a way to show on screen what was printed in pages, keep the story succinct, respet authors' world building and characters,  the list goes on and on. But the recent success of adaptations has proved sci-fi fans love a transition from paper to the silver screen if the execution is right and the source material is respected. But why adapt? Well to put it bluntly while reading is a good habit its not a practical option for everyone and a vast majority of people would prefer watching a movie to reading a book.

While there are many different kinds of literature to choose from, graphic novels are often overlooked despite the success of movies like V for Vendetta and Watchmen. However, the serious fans will tell you there is a huge untapped potential if you know your graphic novels well enough. There is an ocean of graphic novels across genres that have not yet been adapted. With so many great options available directors should have not shortage of options when looking for source materials. With that in mind, here is my pick of 10 graphic novels that should be made into a movie.

While there are many different kinds of literature to choose from, this article focuses on graphic novels which is one of the most overlooked forms of art. WIth so many great graphic novels in the genre directors and studios have no shortage of options when looking for source materials for adaptaions. While graphic novels in and of itself is great to read, its not the most accessible of mediums and a vast majority of people would prefer watching a movie than reading a book.

Science fiction is a genre that works extremely well as a cinema. With so many good graphic novels in the genre, it's safe to say there are dozens of science fiction graphic novels deserving of a movie adaptation. Moreover, the success of such hits as V for Vendetta and Watchmen, has proved that sci-fi fans love a transition from paper to the big screen if the adaptation does justice to the material.

Though reading is a fantastic habit, 

Though reading, as good of a habit as it is, is not the most accessible of mediums since for the vast majority of people its easier to watch a movie than read a book. As a result numerous fantastic stories and characters are trapped and hidden awayy from general audiences and are yet to be adapted. Here is my pick of top 10 that deserve it the most:


However, if done correctly it could easily become a cultural phenomenon like 2001: A Space Odyssey.


But why adapt
Out of all the types of literature Graphic novels are often overlooked 
But what type of literature 

Good literature inspires good cinema! This is true for all genres and especially for science fiction. Whether its the Martian or Arrival you can trace back the success of these movies to the books on which they were based. Its also a safe bet for studios to invest in movies that are adapted from books that already have fanbase.  This is great However adapting science ficiton literature to the big screen is perhaps one of the most daunting tasks a director can take up.

<!-- Reading, as popular of a hobby as it is, can sometimes be limiting medium especially for a genre like sci-fi where the use of effects and high value production can really improve the experience the story has to offer.

As such there are plenty more sci-fi graphic novels that need to make a step into movies. Here is my pick of top 10 that deserve it the most: -->


<!-- Though despite the popularity of characters like Batman and the avengers, there are still legions of untapped potential. There are loads of graphic novels in the sci-fi genre that have yet to be adapted. What better time than age where the medium is a wellspring of adaptations?

<!-- THE GOOD BLOCK
WIth the massive success of Oppenheimer there has never been a better time to adapt The Manhattan Projects by Jonathan Hickman and Nick Pitarra. The biggest selling point for this story is the way it combines history with fiction. however, the story's historical accuracy ends there after that its al fiction. THe premise of the novel is that the project was just a front for numerus secret government projects run by morally challenged scientists. Some of the famous scientists you'd find in it are Robert Oppenheimer who suffers from multiple personalities disorder and a locked up Einstein. The story has everything that  you'd want in a hit movies' screenplay. It is full of humor, satire, absurd innovations like a scientist who is just a radiological mass, intriguiing characters, pan-dimensional space, mythological artifacts from discarded space, artificial intelligence, and the deconstruction of an alien spaceship intricate and captivating plot points which are explored over 6 volumes. In the right hands this could even lead to a franchise. We know how Quentin loves making movies with alterenate history and this could be the perfect project for him if he still wants to make a sci-fi movie.

## 2. On a Sunbeam (Tillie Walden)

![graphic](/img/06/sunbeam.png "novel") 

Putting our Government's dark histories aside for a moment, 
Putting dark history aside for a moment, take a look at a strange tale that is On a sunbeam. On a sunbeam can't truly be put into any one genre. It has elements of both science fiction and romance. The story follows Mia who works in a maintenance spaceship that rebuilds broken structures. Howver her sole purpose for joining the ship is not to rebuild structures but rebuild an old relationship by reconnecting with her lost love. The story takes you on an emotional rollercosaster that will make you laugh and cry sometimes both at the same time. The second half of the novel however is more action loaded and less emotionally charged.

The writer's imaginative storytelling combined with the desperation and hope that accompany the characters make On a Sunbeam a worthy candidate for a memorable romantic sci-fi film with some good action sequences as well - this could end up being the movie that has everything!

## 3. Sentient (Jeff Lemire)

![graphic](/img/06/sentient.png "novel") 

Imagine a group of children stuck in a colony ship in deep space forced to survive on their own after all the adults on the ship get murdered. THe only help they have is the guidance of the onboard AI VALARIE. While survival is the strongest instinct in humans distrust towards AI is the most common sentiment. So the idea that these children now have no other option but to trust AI for survival is an extremely interesting premise.

That's roughly the setup of Sentient by Jeff Lemire. It features plenty of science fiction tropes such as an space pirate invasion, kids in space, AI learning to be a human and a colony ship. A young adult science fiction like Sentient which is a bit soft on science but deals with dystopia, identity and spaceship drama is rare these days so this is definitely a unique novel. Lemire's novel would be absolutely perfect for horror space opera movie or even a miniseries, and someone needs to tip off the studio executives.

## 4. Worlds of Aldebaran  by Luiz Eduardo de Oliveira

![graphic](/img/06/Aldebarannoir.png "novel") 

Luiz Eduardo de Oliveira's Worlds of Aldebaran may sound like science-fiction roleplaying game, but its actually the name of his book that was first released in 1994. The simple but potent idea of humans trying to capture distant planet when Earth becomes inhabitable due to global warming and religious wars would capture the imagination of any sci-fi fan. Even though the plot sounds like something Elon Musk would talk about (in one of his seminas) it is definitely a great place to start a science fiction story.

Though it shares some similarities to the beloved space adventure star trek, it also leans into many of the less popular sci-fi mainstays like corrupt church, body horror and suicide. The novels main focus is colonists dealing with planet level issues that arise due to human error, however the novel does have a tragic tone when it deals with personal problems. Oliveira's book with it space western feel is long overdue for staggering and thrilling series. -->

<!-- ## 5. The Incal By Alejandro Jodorowsky

![graphic](/img/06/incalnoir.png "novel") 

In 1980 Alejando Jordowsky creating a fascinating science fiction tale called the Incal which would later be seen as one of the most legendary French-Belgian Comic.
If you have seen the documentary Jodorowsky's Dune(2013) then you have probably heard about it. Jordowsky's motivation behind this comic is just as notoriously famous as the comic itself.  He wanted to adapt Dune for the big screen but he ended up changing the story too much and the screenplay ended up being 14 hour long. So naturally he couldn't get the budget for it but he did convert it into a graphic novel of its own with the help of French artist Jean Giraud or Mœbius.

This beautiful piece of graphic literature revolves around John Difool, a low class detective in a degenerate dystopian world, who finds his life turned upside down when he discovers an ancient, mystical artifact called "The Incal". THe character and the main story line is definitely something that would attract even the sci-fi fans who aren't aware of the novel itself. Moreover, tHe artwork itself, if translated properly, could lead to visually stunning movie or a series. -->

You follow the story through the eyes of the main protagonist William Mandela who is just an ordinary person studying physics at a university but is pulled into the war to contribute. Even though you may find several aspects of worldbuilding to be a bit unnerving like the views on homosexuality the novel is definitely a masterpiece and deserving of an adaptation.

THe rights to adapt The Forever War has moved through various hands in hollywood since 1988 with Ridley Scott being the one to hold the right at one point. In 2015 Warner Bros acqiored the right to adapt the film and have started the development of the script however so far nothing has come to fruitiion. It's not surprising why so many big names want to adapt this film because if done right it surely has the potential to be a genre defining project. -->


<!-- ## 7. Global Frequency  Warren Ellis

![graphic](/img/06/globalfreqnoir.png "novel") 

The Sci-fi epic Global Frequency has everything: emotionally charging drama, incredible action, mystery, engaging character development  and a bone chilling plotline. The series is just as great as Planetary - another creation of Ellis. The novel already has an army of fans behind it, and for good reason. The premise of the novel is as appealing as it gets. THe novel follows the operations of an intelligence agency that counters that governements and protects the people from the governments' secret projects.

<!-- So far there have been two attempts at adapting the novel into a tv series once by Warner Bros and the second time by Fox. However, both times the project was dropped due to problems with the script. This sci-fi series of 12 issues has a near perfect plot with tons of interesting subplots involving some of the most intriguing motifs like fights with alien, corrupt governments and use of futuristic technology making it an ideal contender for the development of a netflix show or a multiple part movie.  --> -->

## 8. Not All Robots - Mark Russell

![graphic](/img/06/notallrobotsnoir.png "novel") 

In 2021 Mark Russell delivered a fascinating science fiction satirical social commentary in the form of the novel Not All Robots. The central premise of Not All Robots is that every human family is completely reliant on a robot assigned to them to earn their wages. The novel follows Walter family who suspect that their robot is building machines to kill them like many other robots in other families have tried to. Are these robots faulty or are they just unhappy and unappreciated? Is there any hope left for the humans? The story has everything you'd want to see in a movie about robots.

Though it shares some similarities to chatoic futiristic series like Love death and robots it deals with the idea of mutual existence of machines and humans with huge amounts of of dark and heavy humor. An animated series or a movie where sociological impact of AI is explored sounds like a great project for the current times where the evolution of Artificial Intelligence is rapidly gaining momentum and we are being rocketed towards a world where we coexist with robots.

## 9. We3 by writer Grant Morrison

![graphic](/img/06/we3news.png "novel") 

The name We3 might not sound all too familiar to general audiences, but the novel by Grant Morrison actually inspired several elements in the beloved Marvel film Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3. When looking at what makes a science fiction movie entertaining, three cybernetic animals that are created by the governmment and are trying to get home feels like a winning recipe. This critically acclaimed comic mini book series is both intellecutally and emotionally engaging and has perhaps one of the most tragic stories in all of comic book history.


We3 also has the added inclusion of aliens, pirates and futuristic tech all of which result in horrific scenarios where someone's life is almost always in danger. Even though adapting this novel can be a bit daunting and challenging but it would be tremendous accomplisment if done while respecting the author's vision/properly. After all wouldn't you want to see how a dog, cat and rabbit suffering from human cruelty fight for their freedom?

## 10. The Coffin - Phil Hester

![graphic](/img/06/coffin.png "novel") 

The combination of science fiction and superheros is bound to be a winning one in the world of movies. The Coffin follows Dr. Ashtar Ahmad who is pursuing the dream of immortality by building a suit the can store the soul even after the physical body dies and the person can live on forever. However his research comes to an abrupt halt when a tycoon kidnaps his daugther and asks for doctor's suit as ransom. It's twisted, it's firghtening, it's darkly funny, it's everything you would expect from such a premise.

While the novel does have some of the mainstays of a classic sci-fi superhero or supervillian origin story Like Dr. Freeze, it definitely has one of the most original approaches to a thriller. The ardent fans of the novel will tell you that even the story is basic the execution is specatcular and the story will keep you on the edge of the seat as you follow Dr. Ashtar Ahman. Wester's book may have been published in 2001, but there is still nothing quite like it in the film industry 20 years later, and this needs to change by adapting this novel into an action packed and thrilling gory sci-fi flick.

# Gout

## What is Gout?

Gout is a disease in which pain and inflammation occur in the joints because of a uric acid build-up. It is a symptom of arthritis in which you can experience severe pain, redness, tenderness, and swelling in the joints.

It usually happens because the extra uric acid accumulates in the form of crystals in the joints. It is a prevalent disease that affects about 1-4% of the world population. While it can affect anyone, men are more likely to develop Gout than women – about 3-6% of men are usually affected by Gout, whereas only 1-2% of women develop its symptoms.

Gout attacks are often sudden and start with the big toe giving you a burning sensation in your feet.

---

## What are the symptoms of Gout?

There are **4 stages of Gout**, namely:
- Asymptomatic hyperuricemia
- Acute gouty attack
- Intercritical period
- Chronic tophaceous gout  

Each of these stages differs in the associated symptoms. Therefore, knowing these symptoms may help you or your doctor in diagnosing the nature of your Gout.

| **Stage**                | **Characteristics** | **Symptoms**                                                                                           |
|--------------------------|---------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Asymptomatic hyperuricemia** | Caused by the inability of the kidneys to excrete excess uric acid | No symptoms or signs                                             |
| **Acute Gout Attack**       | Monoarthritic: inflammation of one joint – generally the big toe. Other affected areas include: tarsal joints, metatarsal joints, ankle joints, knee joints, wrist joints, metacarpophalangeal joints, interphalangeal joints, hip (rare), shoulder (rare), and vertebral column (very rare). Soft tissue inflammation like olecranon bursitis and Achilles tendonitis may also occur. | Inflammation in joints causing redness, hotness, swelling, and loss of function. For larger joints (like knees and ankles), swelling may not be visible, but pain can be extreme. |
| **Intercritical Period**    | Remission period, starting hours or days after the acute attack subsides. Recurrence may happen if hyperuricemia is not treated. | No symptoms; however, new attacks may occur.                                                         |
| **Chronic tophaceous gout** | Gout becomes chronic if untreated. Crystals form large masses (tophi) around ear joints or under skin tissue. This can cause joint destruction, deformity, and bone erosions. | Symptoms include swelling and tenderness at tophus sites, severe pain, loss of joint function, and restricted range of motion. In more advanced cases, arthritis in multiple joints is common. This may also lead to fever, headache, and malaise. |

**Note:** Arthritis in more than one joint is common in cases of untreated long-term Gout or in postmenopausal women. In such cases, Gout may be treated as a symptom of septic arthritis unless proven otherwise.

---

## What is the main cause of Gout?

Gout occurs when the uric acid in your body increases beyond a threshold level, leading to the deposition of urate crystals under tissues and in joints. 

**Factors affecting urate levels:**
- Height
- Weight
- Blood pressure
- Renal function
- Gender
- Alcohol consumption

Here are the **normal uric acid levels in blood** for different groups:

| **Group**          | **Uric Acid Levels (mg/dL)** |
|--------------------|-----------------------------|
| Adult Male         | 4.0-8.5                    |
| Adult Female       | 2.7-7.3                    |
| Elderly            | Slight increase from younger age |
| Child              | 2.5-5.5                    |
| Newborn            | 2.0-6.2                    |

---

## Causes of Overproduction or Underexcretion

### Overproduction
- **Purine-rich diet:** Meat (beef, pork, lamb), seafood (tuna, codfish), beer.
- **Endogenous purine synthesis:** Malignancy, tumor lysis syndrome.
- **Purine salvage:** HGPRT deficiency (Lesch-Nyhan syndrome), PRPS deficiency.
- **Purine breakdown:** Glycogen storage disease.

### Underexcretion
- **Urinary excretion issues:** Diuretics, kidney failure.
- **Urinary reabsorption:** Alcohol, genetic defects.

**Threshold:** Uric acid levels > 6.8 mg/dL can increase Gout risk.

---

## What is the best doctor to see for Gout?

- **Rheumatologists**
- **Internists**
- **General Practitioners**
- **Orthopedists**
- **Nephrologists**

---

## How is Gout Diagnosed?

### Common Tests and Observations
- **Joint Aspiration (Arthrocentesis):** Synovial fluid is tested for urate crystals.
- **Serum Urate Concentration:** Levels may decrease during an acute attack.
- **Renal Function Tests:** Renal failure may indicate hyperuricemia.
- **Urinary Urate Excretion:** Indicates increased uric acid.
- **Full Blood Count:** Elevated WBCs may indicate septic arthritis.
- **Fasting Lipids/Glucose/Thyroid Function:** Detects associated conditions like diabetes or hyperthyroidism.

**Important:** Immediate joint aspiration is often required if septic arthritis is suspected.

---

## What is the best treatment for Gout?

**Medications for Treatment:**
1. Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs) like Indometacin.
2. Steroids and adrenocorticotrophic hormone.
3. Colchicine.

**Medications for Prevention:**
1. Xanthine oxidase inhibitors like Allopurinol, Febuxostat.
2. Colchicine.
3. Uricosurics like Sulfinpyrazone.
4. Losartan.
5. Flubiprofen.

### Surgery
1. **Tophi Removal Surgery**
2. **Joint Fusion Surgery**
3. **Joint Replacement Surgery**

---

## Home Remedies for Managing Gout Pain
- Ice packs.
- Rest.
- Strong analgesics.
- Weight loss.
- Avoid beer and reduce meat consumption.

---

## Who is most at risk for Gout?

You are at high risk if you:
- Drink alcohol heavily.
