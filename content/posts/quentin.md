Quentin Tarantino has often said he will retire after making ten movies. After once upon a time in Hollywood he is down to his last one. Despite loving all kinds of films as a filmmaker he has stuck to a few genres but has never made a sci-fi movie. But every now and then there have been moments when he could have made a good sci-fi movie infact for a while there it was highly probably that his last movie was going to be a sci fi movie. Quentin Tarantino is best known for his crime and thriller movies but he has also made and a couple of westerns like The Hateful eight and one war movie the Inglorious Bastards and almost all his movies have a few things in common – action, comedy and good music.  

But as a film nerd he has showed interest in all genres especially science fiction which is probably he has often showed an interest in making a movie in this genre.  After watching it follows he had announced at the San Diego Comic Con in 2014 that he is planning to make a science fiction film which would be inspired by movies such as The Thing, The Halloween, Stalker and the Texas Chainsaw Massacre. He has said that his sci fi movie wouldn’t follow the popular tropes of this genre like space but would be more along the lines of a slasher sci-fi horror. However he later cancelled the project. But once again in 2019 he said would consider reviving this project to make it his final film however, he once again cancelled t	he project since he didn’t want it to be his last film . However, if you find this disappointing wait till you find out about the next sci fi project he was going to work on. The pulp fiction director wanted to make a standalone Star Trek movie however he dropped this project because he didn’t want his last movie to be a franchise movie.

Even though Tarantino has never made a sci -=fi movie he is a big fan of the genre and has often called John Carpenter’s Dark Star his favourite sci – fi movie and a masterpiece/ . So would he have made some thing similar to that

## What Kind of sci- fi movie would he have made?/everytime Quentin almost made a sci fi?

The first time Quentin Tarantino came close to making a science fiction film was right after the success of his first movie Death Proof. In 2007 Tarantino was brought onboard to direct the remake of Westworld with Arnold Scwarzenegger playing the role of the lone gun slinger. However the project was scrapped.

## How does Quentin Tarantino directing a star trek film sound to you? 
That is indeed a dream come true for any cinema lover. This dream was extremely close to being realized the second time Quentin decided to work on a sci fi film. Only this time it wasn’t just any science fiction film but Star Trek itself. In December 2017, Quentin discussed the idea of a new star trek film with Paramount Pictures. He would have co directed the movie with J.J.Abrams who had also previously directed and produced Star Trek reboot projects.  Mark L smith began working on screenplay. The movie was still in development till 2019. In the May of 2019 Quentin confirmed that script is under development and that he hasn’t been able to completely focus on the film because  he was busy making once upona time in Hollywood.In june 2019 he received the script from Smith and was going to add his notes to the script. He said that he wanted to make the film rated R. 
Smith gave a hint that the story would have revolved around Captain Kirk and movie wouldhave been inspired from gangster films and would have involved time travel. It would have been a standalone film similar to an episode of Star Trek: The original series/
In the San Diego Comic Con Quentin Tarantino revealed that he was planning on making a slasher sci fi horror movie. He said that in this project he had no plans of following the popular themes of a sci fi prject so it was not going to be a spaceship movie and that the events of the movie would take place on Earth. He stated that the movie It Follows got his interested in this project. So you can imagine the movie to be somewhat along the lines of The Thing, Halloween, Stalker and the Texas Chainsaw Massacre. However, much to the disappointment of sci-fi fans he later dropped this project. 

## Why Quentin Tarantino hasn’t made a sci fi movie?

By the end of 2019 in December Tarantino left the project and instead wanted to make a smaller bdget film which is perhaps the comfort zone of Quentin since most of his movies are small buddget. He also didn’t want his last film to be a franchise film. Regardless of the reason Quentin confirmed the film might still be made he just won’t be the one directing it.

He said he didn’t make this movie because his writing style may be too wordy for the horror aspect of this film
One of the biggest problems with making a good sci fi film is the lack of budget or no backing by a big studio however despite being a relatively nmew director and depsit his first movie having only modest success Quenting had the backing of a big stuidio in warner bros. But there are always two sides of a coin. With big studios you do get access to big budgets but you also have to deal with the creative inputs of non creative executives. This was probably the biggest reason why this project was dropped because as we learnt in the bruce lee controversy of Once upon a time in holllywood despite other peoples opinions Quentin doesn’t like to compromise on his vision. And that’s exactly why This project was never completed. The first problem that Tarantino had with this project was that he was unsatisfied with Schwarzenegger and the studio didn’t want to let him go. Secondly as we know from other Tarantino movies that his movies have a dark tone but the studio was once again against this idea and that’s why he had to walk away from this project.


## Why Quentin Tarantino hasn’t made a sci fi movie?Why it’s unlikely Quentin will ever make a sci fi movie

As Tarantino comes close to reaching his goal of making only 10 movies and having already announced the title of his last project “the movie critic” its highly unlikely a full on sci-fi Tarantino movie will happen now. SO for now its unlikely Quentin Tarantino will make a sci fi movie.
