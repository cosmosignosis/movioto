In the year 1889 Oscar WIlde famously said 'Life imitates art more than art imitates life' which basically meant that realy life imitates the expressions of the art. Future is uncertain but artists, painters, writers and filmakers show an image of the future that they wish or sometimes fear could come true. While the Simpsons have been notoriously famous at predicting the future, other shows and movies have done it as well. This is true in the sci-fi genre more than anyplace else. 

Now that more than 100 years have passed since Georges Méliès made the first sci-fi film "A trip to the moon" in 1902, it's time to see how many modern day inventions were foreshadowed by the countless sci-fi movies that came out since then. So here is our list of some of the most mind boggling modern inventions that a sci-fi movie predicted beforehand or maybe even inspired:


More than 100 years have passed since Georges Méliès made the first sci-fi film "A trip to the moon" in 1902, and since then we have had plenty of sci-fi movies, animated shows and series. So now it's time to see how many modern day inventions were foreshadowed by the countless sci-fi movies that came out since then. 

## 1. Her

Technology has become an integral part of human lives infact people spend more time with their phones than with their family so there is already a sort of realtionship there. However, the movie Her took this relationship to a whole new level by introducing the conecpt of human like relationship with machines. THe movie showed various aspects of AI like AI-generated art and AI having human like conversations. This concept was entirely alien in 2013 when the movie released. It was always thought of as a dystopian reality which would happen some time in the future maybe in a 100 years. However, just in 10 years since the release, everything we saw in the movie is coming to reality.  Well maybe the scale is lesser the effect of AI tech revolution on socity today is similar to what the movie portrayed.

even if plenty of them are still years away from being realized.

## 2. Until the end of the world

Directed by Wim Wenders turned numerous heads with its idea of flat screen television when it released in 1991. It's crazy to think high definition flat screen televisions replacing CRT televisions was considered science fiction, but audiences and inventors clearly liked what they saw. ANother crazy prediction that the movie made and one which is not yet a reality but seems plausible now more than ever thanks to companies like neuralink is the use of a device that sends images directly to the brain allowing the blind to see. This technology which is essential to the plot of the film is similar to a brain-computer interface - different versions of which are under rapid development currently. Soon with this technology people suffereing from loss of eyesight or missing body parts could regain mobility which is what the protagonist in the film was trying to do.

3. Star Trek: The Next Generation

Flip phones were ubiquitous at one point however now they have completely evolved into smartphones but did you know that they were first seen in the classic science fiction television series Star Trek : The Next generation. Well this should not come as a surpise considering how many future inventions the start trek franchise has predicted. Even though the flip phones in the movie are not exactly similar to the conventional smart watches they serve the same purpose. To have envisoned someting that would become a reality much later in the future is surely a testament to the creativity of the makers of this legendary franchise

3. Jetsons

Jetsons is one of the most iconic sci-fi animated series and while it had some outrageous tech it did manage to get a few things right. FOr the instance 3d food printing. In the show the jetsons family had a food printing machine that printed real edible food. The machine looks a lot different from the 3d food printers that you see nowadays in the news but the outcome was the same. As if this wasn't amazing in itself Jetsons also got the domestic robot part right. WHile the robots that curently exist are not as intellignt or friendly as Rosie the robot but we are getting there slowly and steadily.

4. Sleeper - Autonomous cars

When you hear autonomous cars or driverless cars the first thing that probably comes to your mind is Tesla. However do you know the first time dirverless cars wre ever shown in a movie was in 1973 in Woody Allen's sci-fi Sleeper. In just five decades this vision has already become a reality. However the driverless cars nowadays are much more sleeker than what Sleeper, thankfully. While

5. World on a Wire - Virtual Reality

![VR](/img/04/virtualreality.png "virtual reality")  

Virtual Reality as a concept itself is so exciting that it had undoubtedly featured in many sci-fi projects whehter it be in Neal Stephenson's sci-fi novel Snow Crash or in the animated series Johnny Quest. However, for the first time something close to what we now refer to as virtual reality ever featured in a movie was in 1973 in the movie world on a wire. Rainer Werner Fassbinder's movie introduces the idea of living in a simulation inside a computer. Seems like 1973 was really a good year for sci-fi movies
