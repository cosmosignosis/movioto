# Gout

## What is Gout?

Gout is a disease in which pain and inflammation occur in the joints because of a uric acid build-up. It is a symptom of arthritis in which you can experience severe pain, redness, tenderness, and swelling in the joints.

It usually happens because the extra uric acid accumulates in the form of crystals in the joints. It is a prevalent disease that affects about 1-4% of the world population. While it can affect anyone, men are more likely to develop Gout than women – about 3-6% of men are usually affected by Gout, whereas only 1-2% of women develop its symptoms.

Gout attacks are often sudden and start with the big toe giving you a burning sensation in your feet.

## What are the symptoms of Gout?

There are **4 stages of Gout**, namely:
- Asymptomatic hyperuricemia
- Acute gouty attack
- Intercritical period
- Chronic tophaceous gout  

Each of these stages differs in the associated symptoms. Therefore, knowing these symptoms may help you or your doctor in diagnosing the nature of your Gout.

| **Stage**                | **Characteristics** | **Symptoms**                                                                                           |
|--------------------------|---------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Asymptomatic hyperuricemia** | Caused by the inability of the kidneys to excrete excess uric acid | No symptoms or signs                                             |
| **Acute Gout Attack**       | Monoarthritic: inflammation of one joint – generally the big toe. Other affected areas include: tarsal joints, metatarsal joints, ankle joints, knee joints, wrist joints, metacarpophalangeal joints, interphalangeal joints, hip (rare), shoulder (rare), and vertebral column (very rare). Soft tissue inflammation like olecranon bursitis and Achilles tendonitis may also occur. | Inflammation in joints causing redness, hotness, swelling, and loss of function. For larger joints (like knees and ankles), swelling may not be visible, but pain can be extreme. |
| **Intercritical Period**    | Remission period, starting hours or days after the acute attack subsides. Recurrence may happen if hyperuricemia is not treated. | No symptoms; however, new attacks may occur.                                                         |
| **Chronic tophaceous gout** | Gout becomes chronic if untreated. Crystals form large masses (tophi) around ear joints or under skin tissue. This can cause joint destruction, deformity, and bone erosions. | Symptoms include swelling and tenderness at tophus sites, severe pain, loss of joint function, and restricted range of motion. In more advanced cases, arthritis in multiple joints is common. This may also lead to fever, headache, and malaise. |

**Note:** Arthritis in more than one joint is common in cases of untreated long-term Gout or in postmenopausal women. In such cases, Gout may be treated as a symptom of septic arthritis unless proven otherwise.

## What is the main cause of Gout?

Gout occurs when the uric acid in your body increases beyond a threshold level, leading to the deposition of urate crystals under tissues and in joints. 

**Factors affecting urate levels:**
- Height
- Weight
- Blood pressure
- Renal function
- Gender
- Alcohol consumption

Here are the **normal uric acid levels in blood** for different groups:

| **Group**          | **Uric Acid Levels (mg/dL)** |
|--------------------|-----------------------------|
| Adult Male         | 4.0-8.5                    |
| Adult Female       | 2.7-7.3                    |
| Elderly            | Slight increase from younger age |
| Child              | 2.5-5.5                    |
| Newborn            | 2.0-6.2                    |

## Causes of Overproduction or Underexcretion

### Overproduction
- **Purine-rich diet:** Meat (beef, pork, lamb), seafood (tuna, codfish), beer.
- **Endogenous purine synthesis:** Malignancy, tumor lysis syndrome.
- **Purine salvage:** HGPRT deficiency (Lesch-Nyhan syndrome), PRPS deficiency.
- **Purine breakdown:** Glycogen storage disease.

### Underexcretion
- **Urinary excretion issues:** Diuretics, kidney failure.
- **Urinary reabsorption:** Alcohol, genetic defects.

**Threshold:** Uric acid levels > 6.8 mg/dL can increase Gout risk.

## What is the best doctor to see for Gout?

- **Rheumatologists**
- **Internists**
- **General Practitioners**
- **Orthopedists**
- **Nephrologists**

---

## How is Gout Diagnosed?

### Common Tests and Observations
- **Joint Aspiration (Arthrocentesis):** Synovial fluid is tested for urate crystals.
- **Serum Urate Concentration:** Levels may decrease during an acute attack.
- **Renal Function Tests:** Renal failure may indicate hyperuricemia.
- **Urinary Urate Excretion:** Indicates increased uric acid.
- **Full Blood Count:** Elevated WBCs may indicate septic arthritis.
- **Fasting Lipids/Glucose/Thyroid Function:** Detects associated conditions like diabetes or hyperthyroidism.

**Important:** Immediate joint aspiration is often required if septic arthritis is suspected.

## What is the best treatment for Gout?

**Medications for Treatment:**
1. Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs) like Indometacin.
2. Steroids and adrenocorticotrophic hormone.
3. Colchicine.

**Medications for Prevention:**
1. Xanthine oxidase inhibitors like Allopurinol, Febuxostat.
2. Colchicine.
3. Uricosurics like Sulfinpyrazone.
4. Losartan.
5. Flubiprofen.

### Surgery
1. **Tophi Removal Surgery**
2. **Joint Fusion Surgery**
3. **Joint Replacement Surgery**

## Home Remedies for Managing Gout Pain
- Ice packs.
- Rest.
- Strong analgesics.
- Weight loss.

---

## Who is most at risk for Gout?

You are at high risk if you:
- Drink alcohol heavily.
